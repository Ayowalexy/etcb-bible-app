               John was one of the two sons of Zebedee who were of the Twelve Disciples or Apostles of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah (“Jesus Christ” in English, and “Iēsous Christos” in Greek/Latin).  His brother was James.

               John was formerly a disciple of John the Baptist and then became a disciple of Yeshua The Messiah after His baptism. John was a beloved disciple, whom The LORD loved.  John along with Peter and James were particularly very close to The LORD. And the LORD took them to where other Disciples did not go. This includes the Mount of Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1, Mark 9:2, Luke 9:28), and raising of Jairus daughter from the dead, (Luke 8:51-54).

               In this Epistle John starts by confirming his own personal eye witness from his time with the Messiah. He goes on to talk about living in the light of God and showing His love to others. He reminds us of being sinners to whom God extends forgiveness when we confess and repent. The Epistle identifies those who are of God and reminds believers about the new commandment of The LORD, to love one another. Those who love God cannot love the things of the world that lead to sin. Apostle John also talks about deception in the end time and the need to test every spirit, with the standard of love and word of God.

               John was the last surviving of the Apostles. The others had either died or were martyred. He was sent on exile by the Roman Emperor Domitian to the Greek island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea. While there he received and wrote The Book of Revelation.  Apostle John was also writer of the Book of The Gospel of John, The Epistles of 1 John, 2 John and 3 John.
