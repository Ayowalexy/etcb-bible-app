        <Text>[The Commentary About End Time Apostasy And Troublesome Times]</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The time ahead of the return of The LORD will be characterized by lukewarmness and low faith in the things of God, (Luke 18:8, Revelation 3:15-17). It will also be characterized by the rise of many false prophets and christs, preaching heresies and performing miracles. It will be such that if it were possible, even the elect (chosen, approved) of God will be deceived, (Matthew 24:21-24). Added to this will be the unprecedented increase in anguish and tribulation. The result that some believers would willfully, voluntarily or consciously fall away. This falling away from the truth of God, by some of those who were once believers is what Apostle Paul calls the end time apostasy, apostasia, defection, departure, revolt, rebellion, or turning away,  (2 Thessalonians 2:3). It will come through temptation, deception or persecution, (Matthew 24:9-13, 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 1 Timothy 4:1-3).

        The spirit of the anti-Messiah (anti-Christ) would be very strong in the world. Then there will be the actual revealing, the disclosure of that man of sin. He will be a human male, who has wandered away from the path of uprightness into lawlessness. Satan will use him to lead the rebellion against the law of God. He is described as the son of perdition, that is one heading for utter destruction of eternal misery in hell or lake of fire, (2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7:25, Revelation 19:20-21).

        The Holy Spirit has been restraining that spirit till now and will continue to do so, until the appointed time for his reign, (2 Thessalonians 2:6-7). The man of sin will oppose and also exalt himself haughtily above all that is spoken of God. He will do the same against every object (idols, carved images) that people worship. He will even sit in the Temple of God, claiming that he himself is God, (Daniel 9:27, Matthew 24:15, 2 Thessalonians 2:4, Revelation 13:3-8, Revelation 13:14-17).

        The revealing of the man of sin does not mean The Holy Spirit will leave the earth or leave the believers helpless on earth. It just means The Holy Spirit will stop restraining him and will allow him to rise to reign for his appointed time. The Holy Spirit will however continue to convict the world of sin. He will work to strengthen the believers during the great tribulation during the reign of the anti-Christ. He will prepare them for the ultimate day of arrival of The LORD, (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 14:14-16). The lukewarm Church and Israel will first be purified through the persecution they suffer from the ant-Christ or man of sin.

         The Scripture says that the time will be troublesome, perilous, or dangerous, (2 Timothy 3:1-4).  People will become very selfish, loving only themselves. They will also love money. They will be boastful and proud. They will disrespect and say evil things against God (blaspheme). Children will become more disobedient to their parents. People will be unthankful, ungrateful for what they receive from God or others. They will indulge in unholy lifestyles. People will be hard-hearted, unloving to others. They will be unforgiving to those who do wrong to them. They will refuse to be reconciled when there is a conflict with others.  They will be slanderous with false accusation of others. They will have no self-control. They will be fierce, brutal like savages.  They will hate virtues and despise those that are good. They will be traitors and betrayers. They will be headstrong and reckless. They will be haughty, puffed up with pride. They will be lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.

         These will lead to the sudden, unexpected return of The LORD, for the rapture or harvest of the believers. The believers who are prepared and ready will be taken to heaven and it will happen in the twinkling of the eye, (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 14:14-16). Every believer must therefore be ready, watchful and spiritually alert.
