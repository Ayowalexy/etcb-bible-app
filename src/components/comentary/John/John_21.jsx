        Death And Resurrection Awaited Since Adam’s fall: As concerning the redemption of all humans, the death and resurrection of the Lamb of God was what God and the angelic host had been looking forward to for centuries since the fall of Adam and Eve. While His death fully paid for the penalty of sin of the fall, His resurrection brings life. The death and the Resurrection of The LORD is therefore the most important thing that happened for all believers. Believers in the LORD would have been without hope and the most miserable if there was no resurrection in The LORD. He is the first fruit of the dead, (1 Corinthians 15:20). His resurrection confirmed there is hope for every believer after this life. For indeed, those that are asleep (physically dead) in Him will rise up again. Then those who are still alive will be caught up together with them in the air to join The LORD, and will be with Him forever, (1 Corinthians 15:20, 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, 1 Corinthians 15:51-52).        </Text>

        The LORD Yeshua was raised from the dead before dawn on the day after Sabbath, the first day of the week, on Sunday, Yom Rishom. He was raised from the dead by God through the life giving  power of the Holy Spirit, (Romans 8:11).           </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Following His resurrection, there was a powerful earthquake, according to the account of Matthew, (Matthew 28:1-2). This happened when an angel of The LORD (ADONAI) descended from heaven. The angel did not come to resurrect The LORD, for He was already risen by the power of God through the life giving Holy Spirit. The angel did two things. First, he came and rolled back the sealed stone from the entrance to the tomb,          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         where Yeshua was buried. He sat on the stone and waited. Neither did the angel did come to roll away the stone so that the risen LORD Yeshua could come out of the tomb. For The LORD, with His glorified body, could go through any physical barriers of walls, stones, etc. The second purpose of the angel, was for the people of The LORD, His disciples, His followers to see and know that the tomb was empty. Yeshua was no longer there. This was why the angel sat and waited. This was why there was more than one angel, who confirmed to them the resurrection, until The LORD showed Himself!          </Text>

         Here are the events of appearance after the resurrection.

         #1 The Women’s First Visit And The Empty Tomb: The women were the first to come to the tomb very early at dawn with burial spices, intending to anoint the body of The LORD in the tomb. They could not do so on the day He died, because it was the Passover preparation day. There was no time by the time Yeshua died and the body released for burial. They had to wait until the third day, the day after the Sabbath. The women who came included Mary Magdalene, also the other Mary (the mother of James and Joseph), Salome (the mother of Zebedee’s sons), and other women, (Matthew 28:1, Mark 16:1, Luke 8:1-3). When they arrived at the tomb, they saw the stone used to seal the tomb had been rolled and the tomb was empty. The angel informed and assured them that The LORD Yeshua was risen, (Matthew 28:1-7, Mark 16:1-6).

         We do not know how many angels were there. On this great occasion, there may have been a huge company of them, we do not know. Angels can be visible or invisible depending on the purpose of being at a place and instructions they have received from God. Luke reports there were two angels, who spoke to the women about the empty tomb, (Luke 24:3-7). Matthew and Mark report of two, different angels.  Matthew reports of one sitting on the stone that had been rolled away, with appearance like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow, (Matthew 28:2-3). Then, Mark reports of another angel inside the tomb. He looked like a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side, (Mark 16:5-6).                              </Text>

         #2 The Women Leave To Report To The Disciples: The women were perplexed, fearful and joyful at the same time, being told by the angels The LORD Yeshua was risen from the dead. But they went quickly, to go and tell the disciples of their discovery of an empty tomb, and what the angels told them, (Matthew 28:7-8, Mark 16:7-8, Luke 24:6-9, John 20:1-2). Mary Magdalene in particular, told Peter and the other beloved disciple (John). But their reports were not believed.                             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         #3 Peter And John Go To Investigate: Peter and the other disciple, (John) ran as quickly as they could to the tomb to see for themselves, (Luke 24:12, John 20:3-10). The other disciple outran Peter. He stooped down, peered into the tomb and confirmed it to be empty. Peter arrived, and did the same. Then Peter went inside. The other disciple followed him inside as well. They saw the linen burial body wrapping cloths and the face cloth neatly folded there. The face cloth that had been wrapped on His head, had been folded together and lying in a separate place by itself. At this time, they saw the empty tomb, the burial clothes, but they did not see any angels or The LORD. Then they left and went away to their places, puzzled about what may have happened, (Luke 24:12, John 20:8-10).                              </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         #4 Mary Persists and Was First To The LORD: Mary Magdalene went in company of other women to the tomb for the anointing of the body. But they met an empty tomb. She went back into the city with the women to report the empty tomb to Peter and John. Then she came back again to the tomb side. Very likely, she did not come back alone, but in company of the other women, (Matthew 27:61, Mark 15:47, Luke 23:55-56, Matthew 28:1, Mark 16:1, John 20:1)                             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         But Mary Magdalene did not quit. She refused to leave the tomb, but wanted to know what had happened to the body of The LORD.  She remained standing and weeping by the tomb, (John 20:11). As she stooped down again to look into the tomb, she saw this time, two angels, in white guzzling garments. One was at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Yeshua had been laid, (John 20:12). While trying to find out from them about the body of The LORD, a third person showed up behind her. She did not know who the person was, but assumed He was the gardener. In fact, He was not the gardener, but the risen Yeshua Himself! (John 20:14-17). Thus Mary was the first among the followers to have seen The LORD. Mark also reported this fact, Mark 16:9-10). By her actions, Mary Magdalene showed a lot of faith, devotion, determination, tenacity and courage. She left her comfort zone behind. She also ignored the risk posed by the Pharisees, Scribes, chief priests and other leaders of the Jews, who constantly persecuted Him, and finally got Him killed on the cross. And she refused to walk away after Peter and the other disciple did, until she had an answer. No wonder she was rewarded, with being the first to see The LORD after His resurrection. 
                    </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         At this time, The LORD asked Mary Magdalene not to touch Him, because He had not yet ascended to the Father in heaven, (John 20: 17). We do not know if the other women were there or not at this particular time. However, Matthew reports that The LORD appeared to the women on their way into the city, (Matthew 28:8-10). This time, they did hold unto His feet in joy and worship. They went (again) and told the disciples, not of the empty tomb, but this time, about seeing The LORD. The disciples still refused to believe their story, (Mark 16:10-11).

         #5 Yeshua Appears To Two Disciples Going To Emmaus: Yeshua appeared to two disciples (His followers) that same day, after resurrection. This was as they had left Jerusalem and on their way to Emmanus, (Mark 16:12-13,  Luke 24:13-33).  They told some of the other disciples (followers), who did not believe them.  But they also went to tell the Apostles.                         
             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         #6 Yeshua Appeared To Peter: They other disciples, (followers) did not believe the two disciples from Emmaus when told they had seen The LORD Yeshua, (Mark 16:12-13). Then the two disciples from Emmaus went to tell the Apostles of the appearance of Yeshua to them. As they got there to tell their experience, the Apostles were there. The Apostles and others with them confirmed Yeshua was indeed risen and had also appeared to Peter, (Luke 24:34)             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         #7 Yeshua First Appearance To The Apostles: The LORD appeared to the rest of the Apostles, while they were gathered that night in Jerusalem, (John 20:19-25, Luke 24:33-43). They were gathered with the doors lock, and suddenly, The LORD Yeshua showed up in their midst. This was in the evening of that first day, the Sunday of His resurrection. At this time, Thomas was not among them. He decided not to believe until after he sees and touches The LORD for himself.              </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         #8 Yeshua Second Appearance To The Apostles: After the first appearance to them, the Apostles left Jerusalem and went to Galilee where most of them lived. The angels that the women saw by the empty tomb had told them to tell the disciples to go to Galiee, where The LORD will meet them, (Matthew 28:5-7, Matthew 26:32, Mark 14:28) . Yeshua had also instructed them to go to Galilee where He would meet them, (Matthew 28:16-17). He appeared there to them eight days after His first appearance to them. This was also on a Sunday, (John 20:26-29). And this time Thomas was there. He believed after touching His hands and side.             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         #9 Yeshua’s Third Appearance To The Apostles: Apostle John reported that The LORD Yeshua appeared the third time, after His resurrection to the Apostles, while they went fishing in Galilee, (John 21:1-14).           
            </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         #10 Yeshua’s Final Appearance And Ascension: In His final appearance, all The Apostles and disciples had moved back to Jerusalem as He instructed them. And He instructed them to remain there until the Holy Spirit arrived, as promised, (Mark 16:19-20, Luke 24:46-53).  The LORD Yeshua walked with them to Bethany, where the Mount of Olives was. He ascended to heaven, as He blessed them when they got there.  After this, His disciples remained in Jerusalem, and were always going to the Temple, praising and blessing God, (Luke 24:52-53). Then the Holy Spirit came at Pentecost, (Acts 2:1-3).            </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         #11: Other Appearances Of Yeshua: And there were many other appearances to many other disciples. This included the account of Apostle Paul, of the appearance of The LORD to five hundred brethren at once, (1 Corinthians 15:3-8). Paul had seen Him sometime later, (Acts 9:1-9, Acts 22:6-10, Acts 26:13-18, Acts 22:17-21, Acts 23:11).            </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         And The LORD continues to appear from time to time since then as He desires. According to the working of His grace, the one writing this End Time Bible has also seen The LORD Yeshua, a few times (some on His own and also with The Father).       
              </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         He will give eternal life to believers, who remain faithful to the end. They will be like Him when He suddenly comes to take them away to heaven. His glorified body, the things He could do, going through barriers, appearing and disappearing at will, are few examples of what believers can expect at end time, when they are transformed at rapture.               </Text>
