        The Book of Jude or Yehuda also known as The Epistle or Iggeret of Jude is the twenty-sixth book of the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by Jude around  60AD â€“ 65AD.
                                            </Text>
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               It is believed that this Jude was not the Apostle mentioned in other parts of the New Testament, (Luke 6:16, Acts 1:13, John 14:22). Rather this Jude was the full brother of James (who wrote the Book of James), who were both half brothers of Yeshua The Messiah, (Matthew 13:55, Mark 6:3). He intrdouced himself as a brother of James. Both of them became believers and followers of The LORD after His death and resurrection.
                                                                    </Text>               
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               The Epistle warns believers about false teachings and heresies going on. 
                                                                                   </Text>               
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               He challenged believers to stand up for their faith. He warns believers against disobedience and to learn from the examples of how God dealt with those who were disobedient in the past among the Israelites, angels, and destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah for their sins.
