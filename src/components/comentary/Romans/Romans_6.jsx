        <Text>[Commentary About Grace And Being Dead To Sin]</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Scripture says we have been saved by grace, (Ephesians 2:8-9). The salvation and righteousness of every believer are underserved and totally free, through Yeshua The Messiah (Jesus Christ, Iēsous Christos). We become His own and live in Him!          </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Scripture further says that those who are in The Messiah are dead to sin, (Romans 6:2-11, Galatians 2:20, Galatians 5:24, Colossians 2:20, Colossians 3:3-5, 1 Peter 2:24).          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         To be dead to sin is to be totally free from the power, control, inducement, enticement, and desires of sins. Whoever is dead can no longer commit sin, but totally free from the desires of sin, (Romans 6:7)!            </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         A dead body is lifeless and does not respond to anything applied to it. In the same way, to be dead to sin is to be lifeless to sin, but full of life to God. It is to live for God, a completely godly life, free of sin. It is to live for righteousness, (1 Peter 2:24).                       </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         To be dead to sin is to be crucified with Yeshua The Messiah. It is for all parts, passions or desires for sin to be dead! (Galatians 2:20). For those who are in The Messiah have crucified the carnal flesh with its passion and desires for sins, (Galatians 5:24, Colossians 3:3). They have put to death what belongs to the sinful carnal earthly nature, including  sexual immorality, uncleanness, vile passions, evil desires or cravings, and greed or covetousness. For greed is idolatry, (Colossians 3:5, Matthew 15:18-19, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Galatians 5:19-21, Revelation 21:8).           </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Every true believer has been baptized into the death of Yeshua The Messiah, crucified with Him, (Romans 6:2-4). The believer no longer lives a life of their own, the old self, but of Yeshua The Messiah, (Galatians 2:20). For the old self, the sinful, carnal nature, has been crucified with Him on the cross. The sinful nature of the carnal body has been done away with. It has been rendered inoperative. And as a result, the believer is no more enslaved to sin, (Romans 6:6). The believer is totally immersed, submerged, buried deep into The Messiah Yeshua, and living in Him, (Colossians 3:3).             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Being dead to sin, is to live the new life of righteousness in God, with love towards God through The Messiah. To love Him is to obey His commandments, (John 14:15). Being dead to sin is therefore to be free from the desires of a life of disobedience. For disobedience leads to death and not life! For disobedience is sin and sin leads to dead!              </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Being dead to sin is not to allow any parts of oneself as instruments (weapons) of unrighteousness to serve sin. It is to give oneself completely to God, and to use every part of oneself as an instrument (weapon) of righteousness to God, (Romans 6:13).           </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         It is to no longer have the freedom to live a life of sin. It is to no longer be a slave to sin. It is to no longer allow sin to rule over one. Instead, it is to become a slave to righteousness. It is to live under grace, the merciful lovingkindness of God, that comes with righteous living that leads to life. It is to no longer be under the power of sin which leads to condemnation. For living in sin does not lead to life, but condemnation or eternal death!            </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         We have been cleansed from our former life of sin through the blood of Yeshua The Messiah. Through the grace of God, we have now become a new creature in Him (2 Corinthians 2:17). God is now able to live in us as His Temple. Through our fruit of righteous living, we show that we are children of God and He lives in us, (Matthew 7:16-20). Through The Holy Spirit in us, God empowers, energizes us to continue living a godly life that is pleasing to Him. We know what pleases Him through His Law which is now written in our hearts! God does not live in an environment of sin. And neither does The Holy Spirit!. Those who enjoy a lifestyle of sin, will blindly argue The LORD has done all, and the grace is there to cover them. They are those who want to live outside of The LORD, and expect grace to cover them. They are like a branch that wants to live and grow on its own. But a branch that is not in Him is cut off and withers. Then they are gathered and thrown into the fire to be burned, (John 15:6, Matthew 13:41-42, Matthew 13:49-50, Luke 3:17). For if a believer willfully continues to sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice left to cover the sins of such a person. The only expectation from such a person is the certainty of the terrible judgment, and fiery anger which will consume God’s enemies, of which such people has become, (Hebrews 10:16-27). For grace is no longer available.          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         To be dead to sin, is to live within Him. One is either dead to sin by living within Him or dead in sin, living outside of Him. Where God does not abide, sin and death abound. Sin leads to death. A believer cannot continue to live in sin, and expect grace to abound. Such a person becomes an enemy of God. And what abounds from a continued life of sin is death!             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         God has left the choice to us and it is ours to make: the choice of life or death.           </Text>
