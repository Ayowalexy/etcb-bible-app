        The Book of The Gospel According to Mark or Marc, also known as The Gospel of Mark is the second book of the New Testament. The Gospel of Mark is believed to have been written between 66AD – 70AD, by Mark, also known as John Mark.         </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        John Mark was a cousin of Barnabas, a fellow missionary traveler of Apostle Paul. Like Timothy, John Mark’s mother was a strong believer and follower of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah (“Jesus Christ” in English, and “Iēsous Christos” in Greek/Latin). It is most likely that John Mark himself became believer and a follower  of The LORD from his youth. As a follower, he may have witnessed His death and resurrection in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Mary. The Disciples and Apostles were meeting in their house in Jerusalem during the time of severe persecution. This was when Herod killed Apostle James and had kept Apostle Peter in prison, planning to kill him. It was their house where Peter went to meet the other Disciples after being freed from the prison by an angel, (Acts 12:12). And a servant girl, Rhoda was too excited to remember to open the gate for Peter. With these, John Mark had a personal experience and also had close contacts with the Apostles. It was from these experiences that John Mark gathered the information and wrote them down in the Gospel of Mark.          </Text>

        John Mark had also joined Apostle Paul and Barnabas to travel with them in their missions to preach the Gospel of Good News to the Jews and Gentiles. He went with Barnabas after Barnabas and Paul had separated, but later Mark and Paul came back together. He also traveled with Peter to Rome and served as his interpreter. It is also believed that Mark eventually became the Bishop of Alexandria.          </Text>
