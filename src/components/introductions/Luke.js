        The Book of The Gospel According to Luke or Locke, also known as The Gospel of Luke is the third book of the New Testament. It is the longest of all the Books in the New Testament. It gives very detailed account of the genealogy, birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah (“Jesus Christ” in English, and “Iēsous Christos” in Greek/Latin).        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Luke wrote the Book of the Gospel of Luke and also of Acts of The Apostles.  Luke was a physician and not one of the Twelve Disciples or Apostles of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah.         </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Luke abandoned his medical profession to accompany Apostle Paul in his missionary journeys. Luke spent time to interview a wide range of people, including The Apostles and Disciples who had firsthand eye witness about what The LORD did and of His death and resurrection. It was from that he wrote the Book of the Gospel of Luke, as a detailed account for Theophilus, a very noble person.          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         The Book of The Gospel of Luke is believed to have been written by Luke between 80AD and 110AD.         </Text>

         It is uncertain if Luke was a Jew. If he was not, then he would be the only writer of huge volumes of Books in the Bible (Old and New Testaments) who was not a Jew or of the Shemite lineage. But considering his detailed or intimate knowledge of the Old Testament, (Hebrew Bible) and writings of the Gospel of Luke and of The Book of The Acts of The Apostles, it would not be surprising if Luke was in fact a Jew. In Colossians 4:10-11, Apostle Paul mentioned Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus, as the Jews (of the circumcision) who were his co-workers with him in preaching the Good News of The kingdom of God. Perhaps these strictly observe Judaism. Then in Colossians 4:14, Apostle Paul also separately mentioned Luke as our dear friend Luke, the doctor. Perhaps Paul was making a distinction of the work of Luke, which was different from preaching, and not as a Jew or Gentile.         </Text>
