            Bereshit in Hebrew, or Genesis in Greek/English, means "the origin, beginning or starting point" of coming into being.  It is the first book of the Old Testament, of the Hebrew Scripture, and also of The Torah or The Law of Moses.

            The Book of Genesis gives detailed account of the creation of mankind, animals and the other things on earth. It gives account of the generation of mankind on earth, from Adam to Noah. The whole of that generation of mankind, was judged by God to have departed from His ways, and gone into all manners of sins and evil. The Scripture says that the wickedness (sins, abominations) of the people throughout the earth was great, and every desire of the thoughts in their hearts was only evil continuously, (Genesis 6:1-7). They had gone totally apostate, away from God. So, that generation was destroyed and brought to an end through flood, which covered the whole world. Only Noah, his wife, their three sons and their wives, a total of eight people, were saved.

            Genesis also contains the account of the new start, of human beings on earth, after the flood. All human beings on earth since after the flood, are descendants from the three sons of Noah, namely Japheth, Shem and Ham.

         Genesis also gives detailed account of the genealogy of the line of Shem, through Abraham to the Israelites or Jews. Nearly all of the prophets and writers of the Old Testament and the New Testaments  are of the descendant of Shem. God through the Jews gave the Law and commandments to guide mankind. He also gave the Savior, The Messiah, through the Jews to die for the sins of all in the world.
