               John was one of the two sons of Zebedee who were of the Twelve Disciples or Apostles of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah (“Jesus Christ” in English, and “Iēsous Christos” in Greek/Latin).  His brother was James.

               John was formerly a disciple of John the Baptist and then became a disciple of Yeshua The Messiah after His baptism. John was a beloved disciple, whom The LORD loved.  John along with Peter and James were particularly very close to The LORD. And the LORD took them to where other Disciples did not go. This includes the Mount of Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1, Mark 9:2, Luke 9:28), and raising of Jairus daughter from the dead, (Luke 8:51-54).

               John was the last surviving of the Apostles. The others had either died or were martyred. He was sent on exile by the Roman Emperor Domitian to the Greek island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea. While there he received and wrote The Book of Revelation.  Apostle John was also writer of the Book of The Gospel of John, The Epistles of 1 John, 2 John and 3 John.
