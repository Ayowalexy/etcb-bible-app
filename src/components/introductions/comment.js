        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Pagan societies, both in ancient times and present time, have national gods, deities and idols they worship. Being part of their culture and practices, carved images of the idols or deities are proudly displayed in shrines, homes, restaurants, monuments. They do not know or worship the Most High God, who is the Almighty creator and possessor of the heavens and the earth, (Genesis 14:18-20).

               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               Some of the images of the deities or idols are carved from stones, wood or molten metal and elaborately dressed in gold and silver, (Psalm 115:4-8, Isaiah 40:18-20, Isaiah 44:9-20, Isaiah 46:5-7,  Jeremiah 10:2-7). They make images of these idols or gods with their own hands, and begin to worship them. It was common in many nations of old, and still so in some nations even today. Many of them also engage in worship of the heavenly Hosts of stars, moon, sun, planets, engaged in worship of idol images.
                                                                                                            </Text>

               After the Israelites were freed by GOD Almighty, from their slavery in Egypt, they went on to possess the promised of Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey, (Exodus 3:17). The LORD warned the Israelites, before and after they got to Canaan, against serving, bowing down,  worshiping other gods or even swearing by their names in the land of Canaan, (Exodus 23:23-24, Leviticus 26:1, Deuteronomy 7:16-26, Deuteronomy 12:2-3, Deuteronomy 29:16-18 ). 
                                                                                                            </Text>
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               In the land of Canaan were the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. They worshipped Baal as the chief god (idol, deity). Baal was the male god of fertility, seen as having the power for reproduction of life (fertility) and also for harvest yield of crops. 
                                                                                                                           </Text>
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               The worship of Baal as chief god went beyond the land of Canaan. He was called different names in different nations. Among the Canaanites, this deity was known as Baal.  Among the Ammonites, Baal was also the chief god worshipped as Molech, Moloch, Milcom, or Malcam, (Leviticus 18:21, Leviticus 20:1-5, 1 Kings 11:4-8, 2 Kings 23:10, Jeremiah 7:31, Jeremiah 19:5, Jeremiah 32:35). In the Mesopotamian region, Baal was also known and worshipped as Tammuz (Ezekiel 8:14). Among the Babylonians and Chaldeans, Baal was known as  Bel, their chief god worshipped in the Tower of Babel, (Isaiah 46:1, Jeremiah 50:2, Jeremiah 51:44].  And 
                there were other gods, deities among them such as Moredoch in the time of Nebuchardnezzar. And there was Nebo the god who presided over learning, and letters to the Babylonians, Hermes to the Greeks, Mercury to the Latins, and Thoth  to the Egyptian. 

                                                                                                                           </Text>

               The generations of Israelites that followed after the death of Moses, Joshua and those who came out of Egypt did not know God Almighty or worshipped Him wholeheartedly. The Israelites succumbed to the customs and practices of the Canaanites and surrounding nations, contrary to the warnings from God. On getting to Canaan, they abandoned God Almighty, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. Instead, they worshipped Baal and built many high places or pagan shrines for the worship of Baal. 
                                                                                                                           </Text>               
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               Solomon built many temples for the worship of the gods of his many foreign wives, (1 Kings 11:4-8). The worship of Baal gained further prominence in the nation of Israel following the marriage of King Ahad to Jezebel, (1 Kings 16:30-34). Jezebel was the daughter of the king of the Sidonians, called Ethbaal (meaning with Baal).  Prophet Elijab fought against Baal and his prophets who were under the care of Jezebel and Ahab. After their defeat in a contest, Elijah had 450 prophets of Baal slaughtered to bring purity back to Israel, (1 Kings 18:18-40).
                                                                                                                                          </Text>

               Shrines for Baal and other gods were common places in the streets of Jerusalem and all over the cities of Judah before God sent them out on exile. The LORD had warned them not to let any of their offspring to pass through fire of ritual sacrifice for Molech, (Leviticus 18:21). Yet Israel, Judah and their kings went deeper into more despicable practices in their worship of Baal. In Judah, they built pagan shrines or high places at Topheth (the fire pit), which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom. There they committed all kinds of sexual immoralities, orgies, reveling in their worship of Baal and other gods. They also burnt their sons and daughters in fire, as sacrifice to Baal, also called Molech, Moloch  (2 Kings 23:10, Jeremiah 7:31, Jeremiah 19:5, Jeremiah 32:35, Amos 5:27).
                                                                                                                                          </Text>

               Like King Ahab and Jezebel of (the ten tribes of) Israel, King Manasseh of Judah was fully devoted to the worship of Baal , his consort Asherah (known also as the Queen of Heaven), and other pagan practices. (Refer to the commentary at the end of Jeremiah 7  On “Asherah, Queen Of Heaven, Easter And Passover”).   King Manasseh built wooden images (idols) for Asherah and brought it into the Temple of God, built by Solomon. He was also engaged in the worship of the heavenly Hosts of stars, moon, sun, planets, engaged in worship of idol images, (2 Kings 21:3-7). He made his son pass through the fire, (burned as sacrifice) to Baal. He practiced soothsaying, witchcraft, and consulted spiritists and mediums. 
                                                                                                                                          </Text>

               Despite repeated warnings from God, Almighty, they refused to change. Therefore, God in His wrath, sent them out in exile from the land of Canaan. The ten northern trips of Israel, led by Ephraim were taken captive by Assyria, (2 Kings 17:4-24). The two southern tribes Judah (and Benjamin) were taken into exile to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, (2 Kings 24:13-20, 2 Kings 25:1-21).
                                                                                                                                                         </Text>

               There is idolatry now in many parts of the world, including in advanced western societies. Idolatry will continue to increase in the end time. Many of the ancient eastern pagan customs and practices will abound all over the world. Sorcery, spiritism, mediums, magic, witchcraft, soothsaying, etc will increase. Global alliances will be formed between many nations, enabling easy interchange and export of wicked and abominable practices between the east and the west, (Isaiah 2:5-9).

        The Israelites were deceived by the Gibeonites to avoid being destroyed in Canaan, (Joshua 9:1-17). A covenant was made and they became servants of the Israelites as woodcutters and water carrier for the Temple of the LORD, (Joshua 9:18-27). King Saul violated this covenant and tried to wipe them out. This later brought about famine during the reign of King David, until their death was avenged on Saul’s family, (2 Samuel 21:1-9).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The LORD does not tempt anyone. Temptations are designed to bring about a fall of a person. Temptation is evil and comes from the Devil. Temptation can lead to sin. 
         </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        God is holy, and nothing sinful originates or is found around Him. Since temptation can lead to sin, temptation does not come from God. When someone is being tempted, the person should not say, “I am being tempted by God”. For God cannot be tempted by what is evil. And He Himself does not tempt anyone (entice anyone to sin), (ref James 1:13, Deuteronomy 8:2, Jeremiah 17:10, Proverbs 17:3). It is because of the potential sinful ending or nature of temptation that Yeshua The Messiah ask us to pray not to fall or succumb to temptation, (Matthew 6:13, Matthew 26:41).
                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Those who belong to the Devil are already with him and he does not need to do anything more to bring them down to his side. What he does is maintain their imprisoned state. 
                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        However, the Devil tempts the children of God. There are two reasons: He may tempt because an opportunity has presented itself. This is when he sees a person is being enticed or vulnerable to something in his mind. It is like a low hanging fruit for him to pick.
                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Scripture explains this very clearly: That temptation comes when someone allows himself to be drawn away by his own sinful desires (lust). Then the person becomes enticed (entrapped), finding the sinful desire to be pleasurable, (acceptable). When a sinful desire has been conceived (accepted) in the mind, it results in taking a sinful action to satisfy the desire. And when the sinful action has been taken (completed, matured), it results in spiritual  death, the separation of the person from God, (ref James 1:14-15, Genesis 3:6-8).
                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Secondly, the Devil often initiates temptations of children of God out of pure jealousy. He desires very much to see their down fall like himself. When they sin, they fall into his own sinful state and displease God. 
                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Apart from tempting, the Devil also brings trials and persecutions. This is again out of jealousy and hate for the children of God. This was the reason for the persecution of Job by the Devil. The Devil had become jealous of Job because he was so righteous, very pleasing to God and was enjoying God’s favor and blessings. The Devil did not like that. So, he went to God to accuse Job, (Job 1:6-12, Job 2:1-7). Trial and persecutions can bring out conditions for temptations. So his first objective through trial and persecution is to weaken the resolve of the believer, to the point where the person becomes tempted to deny, sin or fall away from God. 
                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Devil did not start with tempting Job. Job had consistently proved to fear God, to be righteous, and well. So the condition was not right for Job to be tempted to fall. He could not be easily tempted with anything to make him fall. So the Devil resolved to trial and persecution. His desire was for Job to be persecuted to the point of despair, when Job may become vulnerable to temptation and so fall into sin. For example, at his initial point of despair, Job’s wife was used to tempt him to see if he would curse God, sin and die.
                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Although God does not tempt, He does however, examine the content of the heart. The purpose is to show or confirm the brightness or faith of the person in Him. This was also why He allowed Satan to persecute Job. God’s other purpose of examining the content of the heart is not to destroy the person. His desire is to flush out, empty out, every carnal sinful nature or desire of the world from the believer. The person is so to say, refined through fire. In this case, He may allow the Devil to bring out a trial or persecution. God does not go beyond the point of examining or refining. But the Devil does.
                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Unlike God, the Devil is not interested in refinement but in sin and fall of the person under trail or persecution. So while God may allow the Devil to bring about trial of faith and persecution, the Devil may for his own purpose follow through with temptation. He pushes the trial or persecution beyond the boundary to make the person become vulnerable to temptation. He tries to break the outer shell of resolve resistance first. This is why a person under trail and persecution must remain vigilant through the Holy Spirit. He should resolve through the power and help of the Holy Spirit to remain faithful to God, whether God shows through or not. He must have the spiritual mindset like that of the three Hebrew children. They said to Nebuchadnezzar whether God comes through for them or not, they prefer death to bowing down to the idol or statute of Nebuchadnezzar, (Daniel 3:13-18).
                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        For after a person has been weakened enough to the point that he starts doubting God, the Devil will follow through with temptations, taking advantage of desire. But even when trial transitions into temptation by the Devil, God will not allow us to be tempted beyond our ability, (1 Corinthians 10:12-13).
                         </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        In the end time, God will refine those who need further refining through fire of trial, (Zechariah 13:9). They will go through severe persecution and trials, or great tribulation to flush out all remaining desires for the things of the world. His purpose is not to destroy, because the Souls are precious to Him. His desire is for them to wholly come to His side, in a pure and holy state, having no desire anymore for the things of the world. It becomes very difficult for them to be tempted by anything of the world the Devil may present to them.
                         </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        No one looks forward to trials or persecutions in life because they are not enjoyable. Job certainly did not enjoy it and no one out there would naturally enjoy it. However, trials and persecutions are inevitable. But the Scripture says that we should not give up or be saddened when we face trials or persecutions of one type or another. We should remain joyful, by drawing on the strength and joy that comes through the Holy Spirit. The reason is because ultimately, when faith is tested, it leads to the development of patience, endurance or perseverance. When patience is fully developed, it brings about growth and maturity in completeness of approved character, lacking in nothing, (James 1:2-4,  Ephesians 5:22-23, Romans 5:3-4, Matthew 4:3-11, Luke 4:3-13, 1 Corinthians 10:12-13, James 1:12-15).
                         </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        God had established his hedge of protection around Job. In the same way, we have God’s hedge of protection around us as believers. We are protected by the blood of The Lamb. 
                                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Also just as Satan went to accuse Job, he does the same against believers. He accuses them day and night, to see their down fall and condemnation, (Revelation 12:10-11). 
                                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        But because we have the righteousness of God through The Messiah, no weapon fashion against us will prosper. And every tongue that rises up against us in judgment we will condemn, (Isaiah 54:17, James 4:7). 
                                 </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Furthermore we have Yeshua The Messsiah who is our Advocate before God. He pleads our case. When under trial or persecution or temptation, we must also go to God for wisdom, (James 1:5). We should not think we can do it on our own, but through the power of The Holy Spirit. We must also pray and fight back with the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God!

        Reasons Why Believers Go Through Trials
                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The believers will each be tested, and it is not because of sin. It is for them to grow in their relationships  with God. They go through the cycles of training, testing and graduation, as they move to the next level.
        God is continuously building and pruning His children to make them more productive and to fulfill His purposes in their lives, (John 15:1-2). He prunes to remove the dead or the weak areas to create room for greater growth.
         </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         There are several cycles in growth and maturity. Within a cycle, the child of God goes through building up and pruning. Then comes the testing and examination, during which God releases every believer, every faithful child of His, for the examination or testing. The child of God successfully defeats the enemy in the spiritual battlefield of that cycle. Each successful cycle ends with graduation, joy and celebration from that level of training. Then a new and higher one starts.
                         </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         God does not allow anyone to be tested beyond their grade level, that is their level of ability, (1 Corinthians 10:13). A grade 1 will not be tested with a grade 2. And God is always available, ready to help, providing a way of escape, when the one being tested cries for His help. 
                                  </Text>

         God allows the testing for many reasons:

         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         God does it to examine the content of the heart, (Jeremiah 17:10). He does so to know the state, the motive, to show or confirm the firmness of the faith of the person in Him. He is checking the integrity of our heart, along with our faithfulness, and commitment to Him. The believer being tested also gets to know the true state of the heart and of his/her faith in God. The one who denies Him at the slightest sight of trouble, knows where he/she stands in faith. The one who continues to hang on despite adverse conditions also will know. So God allows the training and testing of His children.

         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         God does it to get His children to be fully conformed to His standard, and not to the standards of this world. God does not want the mind of the believer to be conformed to the standards of this world. God wants to get the mind of the believer away from loving the world or the things that the world has to offer. For friendship with the world means enmity with God. Those who set their minds on the things of the flesh, live according to the sinful carnal nature. He wants the believers to set their minds on the things of The Spirit. For all the things that the world has to offer are: the lust (sinful carnal desires, cravings) of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride (boasting, self-confidence) of life. They are not of The Father but of this world, (Romans 8:5-6, Romans 12:2, James 4:4, 1 John 2:15-17). So God allows the training and testing of His children.

         God wants His children to remain as His chosen people, a royal priesthood, a people of God’s own special possession, chosen to declare the excellence (praises) of the wondrous deeds of Him, who called them out of darkness into His marvelous light!, (1 Peter 2:9-10,  Revelation 1:5-6, 2 Corinthians 6:14, Ephesians 5:7, Ephesians 5:11). So God allows the training and testing of His children.
                                           </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         God wants total and complete obedience of His children to Him, lacking in no area. Obedience is how God measures our love for Him, (1 Samuel 15:22-23, John 14:15). No form of disobedience can attain eternal life. God wants His children to be fully ripe and ready, to attain eternal life with Him. So God allows the testing of His children.
          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         God is looking to see our love for Him, if He is first priority. He wants to see the believer is prepared to leave, lose, forego, turn the back to what is most important to the person within or through that test, to demonstrate or for the sake of our love, commitment and obedience to Him. It typically represents a major sacrifice or a huge loss that would seem impossible to replace in the condition or situation of the person. It may be potential loss of comfort, it may be something very pleasurable, it may be material or wealth like Job did, it may be position, it may be a loved one such as a child like Abraham or even Job, it may be money, it may even be life itself, like Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. It is not really that God wants the person to lose any of them, but He wants to see if the person has gotten to the point of being prepared to forego it for the sake of love, commitment or obedience to God. In the end, God turns around to make alternative provisions and/or blesses the person back.

         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         God does allow the testing of His children as a means to prune them to be more productive. He does this for His children to mature, become well equipped, fruitful and able to fulfill their assigned purposes. For He has a purpose assigned for each of His children. He wants all of them to grow and attain in Him. The believer needs to continue to learn, be pruned and grow in their relationship and faith in God. This is for them to be more fruitful for God. So God allows the testing of His children. He puts them through the battlefield with the enemy. They mature and gain confidence in their victory over the enemy.

         Many holy people of old in the Scriptures attained to where God wanted them. For example, Abraham got to the point of total trust and obedience to God. Abraham demonstrated that his love for God was much higher than his love for Isaac. Job also got to the point of total fear of God and trust in Him. Despite all the afflictions that had happened to him, he refused to fall into the temptation brought through the wife, to curse God and die. Instead, he said he was prepared to accept the will of God, good or bad, (Job 2:9-10). He continued steadfastly in his fear and love for God. Also Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego got to the point of total trust and love for God.  They were ready to die for their love and faith in God. And God showed through, (Daniel 3:17-18, Daniel 3:25-27).

         Also, in the case of The LORD Yeshua, He prayed to God saying: ‘not my will but your will be done’, (Luke 22:42). He submitted Himself to God and continued steadfastly in total obedience to God.

            A blessed person is joyous and happy! Is full of happiness, joy and contentment! Good things come from The LORD and His blessing makes a person full of happiness, joy and contentment. It does not come with sorrow, curse, mourning, or ruin. A person who fears The LORD is blessed. A person who meditates on the word of The LORD is blessed. For The LORD in turn draws near and delights in the revelation of Him, His Mightiness and goodness to such a person.

        The earth belongs to The LORD and the fullness in it. There is no material or wealth we can give Him which He does not already have or cannot create. And those come from Him to us. But we can bless Him with our obedience, praise and worship. To bless the LORD is to praise and worship Him in words or songs from the heart. It is not about material offering or money to Him. It is of the soul and being of a person praising his/her Creator.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        To bless the LORD is to render words of praise, gratitude and appreciation of Him to Him from the heart. It could be spoken out aloud or in silence. Blessing the LORD in words or songs could be accompanied with dancing or kneeling or prostrating before Him, such as in the manner demonstrated in 1 Chronicles 29:20. It should be done in spirit and in truth, (John 4:24). It should be done with sincerity, wholeheartedly and voluntarily.
                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        To bless the LORD is to offer praise and worship to Him from a heart of obedience. For obedience is better than sacrifice, (1 Samuel 15:22-23). A heart of disobedience is considered a wicked heart. Praise or worship from such a disobedient heart is as of hypocrisy and lip service, (Isaiah 29:13; Matthew 15:7-9, Mark 6:6-7). It is an abomination before The LORD. For God looks at the heart and delights in praise, worship or offering from an obedient heart.

Solomon composed 3,000 (three thousand) proverbs, and 1,005 (one thousand and five) songs, (1 Kings 4:29-34). He also spoke of the rewards of wisdom, and foolishness, discipline, compassion, integrity, grace, as well as the evil of alcohol, pride, arrogance, self-praise, borrowing and collaterals, bad associations, pursuit of wealth, hot-temper, contention, wickedness, deception and falsehood, oppression, laziness, gluttony, gossips, slanders, immoral relationships (harlots and adultery by married women), etc.

        Wisdom and Knowledge come from the fear of The LORD, (Proverbs 1:7, Proverbs 9:10, Proverbs 8:13, Job 28:28, Psalm 111:10). To fear The LORD is to hate what is evil! (Proverbs 8:13).

        Wisdom and Knowledge are for God’s glory, and abide as long as we continue to fear him. The choice to fear God remains with us to decide. The enemy can take advantage, when people choose to disobey God. At some point, King Solomon who started well with the fear of God digressed into evil. He violated God’s commands concerning foreign idolatrous women, and progressed from there to build temples for their gods and burned incense to them, (1 Kings 11:1-13, Deuteronomy 7:2-6, Deuteronomy 17:14-20, 1 Peter 2:9, 2 Corinthians 6:14). But the gift of God is without repentance of Him, (Romans 11:29). God is also no respecter of persons. God punished him for this, but his soul was saved (after repentance)!  For Solomon through his actions had explored wisdom in the positive and foolishness in the negative sense, and himself came to a final conclusion, that the duty of all mankind is to fear God and keep His commandments, (Ecclesiastes 1:12-18, Ecclesiastes 12:13-14).

In the New Testament, The LORD, also used the method of parables for communicating when He was on earth. It was for the hearers to go and think about it. However, He would later explain to His disciples when they ask Him, (Matthew 13:10-13). The parables were earthly stories with meanings for the kingdom of God. Many of the hearers were not interested in hearing about the kingdom of God. Therefore, they did not understand. But those who were interested, received understanding.

        God’s first thought for us is not about death, but of life. It is of abundant life on earth, followed by eternal life with him, (John 10:10, John 3:16, Revelation 2:7, Revelation 22:1-2, Revelation 22:14-15). 
                </Text>

        It is God’s desire that we live long, (Psalm 91:14-16, Genesis 5:1-32, Genesis 11:10-24, Deuteronomy 34:7, Job 42:16). 
                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        But for how long we live depends on how much time is needed to fulfill God’s purpose for each person on earth. For example, both John the Baptist and The LORD lived for less than 35years to fulfill His purpose for them on earth. On the other hand, Enoch lived for 365years before being taken away, (Genesis 5:21-24). Methuselah (Enoch’s son and grandfather of Noah) lived for 969years to fulfill his purpose, (yes he had one) till the year just before the flood came. Noah lived for 950 years. Moses lived for 120years to fulfill God’s purpose. Similarly Abraham lived for 175years to fulfill God’s purpose and so did Job. However, God may also cut short a life if it is completely derailed from His purpose into wickedness or when the allotted time of mercy for the wicked is exhausted, (Numbers 16:16-33, Acts 5:1-11).

        The life span of mankind is not set at 120years. Many have confused the statement God made not to strive further with mankind but to allow them to continue for another 120 years before the flood came, (Genesis 6:3).  It was an added time of grace for repentance. It was also during this time that the Ark was built. Noah’s three sons, Japheth, Shem and Ham were born after this statement (or about 100years before the flood, when Noah was 500years old). God’s prophesies are ever firmly established and fulfilled. So, if the desire or command of God was for mankind to live for only 120years, then Shem for example who was born after the statement would not have lived for 620years (Genesis 11:11). The scripture also did not record the other two sons died before Noah, who lived for another 350years after the flood, (Genesis 9:28). They lived long after the flood, and had many children. Also, if God had pegged the lifespan of mankind to 120years, then neither would the generation who were born after the flood, lived for between 200years and 400 years, (Genesis 11:11-22). Similarly, Abraham, Sarah, Job, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, etc lived beyond the 120years. However, due to sin, the life span of mankind began to degrade from the time of Adam, and is down to around a tenth of that today.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Neither is 70 years the set life span of mankind on earth! If so, then why do many people in this current generation live beyond this to 90years or 100years? Did God change this without telling us. No! For He did not set it at 70years! Many have confused Moses’ statement in Psalm 90:10.  It becomes clearer when we look at the original meaning of the word Moses used.  It is “active, hot or warm years”.  So it actually reads: “The active (hot, warm) years of our lives is seventy, and, if we are still strong, eighty years. Yet, the years are only full of struggles and pains. The end comes quickly, and we fly away”, (Psalm 90:10).  This is in agreement with what we know even in our present days. Many today live beyond 70years, but degradation of strength falls after 70years, and only a few are still very active or agile after 80years.

        Length of life degrades with sin, and sin came through Satan. In the end time, just as the LORD returns with the Saints from heaven, Satan will be imprisoned for 1000years (Revelation 20:3). During that time, the LORD, the source of life will reign on earth, initially for 1000years. In the millennium reign, sickness and early death would be a thing of the past (except in the case of sin by an individual). The falling trend of life expectancy will be reversed at the millennium, when the humans on earth will have longer life. It would be least ten times longer than the present, as long as a millennium.

Their children or offspring will be the descendants of the blessed of God. They will receive instant answers to their prayers, (Isaiah 65:20-24).

        King Solomon in his lifetime had 700 (seven hundred) wives who were princesses, and 300 (three hundred) concubines, (1 Kings 11:3).  However, Shuamite was very special. King Solomon fell in love with Shulamite, after acquiring sixty queens, eighty concubines and countless virgins, (Song of Solomon 6:8). Shulamite was especially flawless, perfect in all forms and very peaceful. She was well admired by other queens, concubines and women in King Solomon’s life. While growing up, Shulamite’s family protected her from being wayward until her marriage, (Song of Solomon 8:8-9).

        Shulamite was black and very beautiful. She started life as a vineyard caretaker for her family and herself. She did this under the hot sun, which made her even much darker (tanned) and glowing than the other young women of Jerusalem, who were not exposed to the sun, (Song of Solomon 1:5-6). King David was another person who spent his early years under the sun as a shepherd for his family, (1 Samuel 16:11-12). David was described as radiant, glowing and ruddy. King Solomon shared a passion for the outdoor with Shulamite. Solomon, like his father king David, was also described as radiant (dazzling) and ruddy. King Solomon also had black hairlocks, which was a thick, bushy, and wavy, (Song of Solomon 5:10-11).

        Shulamite’s love for Solomon was very passionate. It was described as a fierce fire that could not be extinguished by any amount of water or flood, (Song of Solomon 8:6-7). On his part, King Solomon loved her above all other women. His love for Shulamite was so deep that he spent much time with her and wrote about their romantic life. This was despite more than 1000 other queens, concubines and young women in his life, as well as his responsibilities as a reigning king over Israel and provinces.

        Also, no human being, can see God in His true or full glory and live. Moses who was highly favored and a friend of God, came close, but did not! God told Moses, “You will not be able to see My face, because no human being can look at Me, and remain alive”, (Exodus 33:19-23, Numbers 12:6-8). So God allowed His glory to pass by, as He pronounced His Names, while covering the face of Moses. Even the Seraphim angels that Prophet Isaiah saw around His throne have six wings of which two are used to cover their faces, (Isaiah 6:1-2).

        While no human can see God in His glorious form and live, God has however appeared to many of His servants as recorded in the Scripture. This is because when God appears to any human being, He does not do so in His full glory. God appears in a form that is more appropriate, convenient for us and for a purpose. He does so to convey a particular message. God created mankind from dust, in the likeness of His image and with His attributes, (Genesis 1:26-28). God appears in a physical form to us in human form, and as a man. For the scripture refers to God as a He.

        God appeared to Abraham, who was His friend, in a simple human form and did not show off His power. He even ate with Abraham and they had conversations together as friends, (Genesis 18).  God appeared to Moses many times, and in one occasion along with the seventy leaders of Israelites, who ate in His presence and did not die, (Exodus 24:9-11). This was at the period He was establishing His covenant and commandments with Israel.

        In the case of Prophet Isaiah, He appeared as a King, (for He is the King of kings), who is Holy, righteous and enthroned on High. The revelation of the holiness of God shows our sinful nature in its raw form, deserving of death!  This was why Prophet Isaiah exclaimed: “Woe is me, for I am undone (will perish, be destroyed). I am a man with defiled lips!, (Isaiah 6:5). But God is merciful. Isaiah’s guilt and sin were taken away. God later sent His begotten Son, for the whole of mankind on earth, not to condemn us, but to redeem us from our sins, to give eternal life to all who will receive Him, (John 3:16-17).

        Apart from Abraham, Moses, and Isaiah, God had also appeared to Daniel, Ezekiel and John in various forms, (Daniel 7:9-11, Ezekiel 1:26-28, Revelation 4:2-11).

        He had also appeared, at least twice to His servant, (the one who wrote this End Time Bible). So have the Son and the Holy Spirit. In one instance, all three of them had appeared together. And in other times, with the company of angels. God is purposeful. These appearances were to convey specific messages, concerning the coming arrival of the end time. For God does not do a thing (that affects mankind on earth) until He first informs His servants, (Amos 3:7).

        God the Father featured more in appearances to the prophets in the Old Testament times. The Son and the Holy Spirit were relatively silent at that time, unknown to them.

        We must however be very careful about visions and messages. We must make certain to confirm the source. For not all visions or messages are from God. Falsehood and deception will multiply in the end time. Whatever visions or messages someone receives, whether directly from God Himself, or delivered through His angels, messengers, or prophets must always be confirmed. It must be confirmed with His Word. The Scriptural confirmation is the proof we must always look for. The Holy Spirit will always confirm with the Scriptures if we ask Him for help. It is one of His roles in the end time to reveal the truth to us. He will reveal or confirm that which is from the Father or from the begotten Son.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Righteousness or acts of righteousness can be like filthy or not filthy rags.  Right from the moment of conception in the womb or birth, every child comes out wearing the garment of the nature of sin, (Psalm 51:5).  This garment of sin came from Satan through Adam and Eve when they fell in disobedience to God, when the Serpent tempted in the garden of Eden, (Genesis 3:1-13). Before then, there was no sin or unrighteousness in Adam or Eve. But from then on, every human being born, of man and woman, and not of the Spirit of God, goes through life wearing the filthy garment or nature of sin and unrighteousness. Cain, their first child, who was born after the fall, grew up to be a murderer, being consumed with jealousy of Abel, (Genesis 4:1-10). 
                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Righteousness, is the standard of acceptance before God. Righteousness comes from God Himself. No amount of money can buy it. It has never been for sale from the beginning and will never be. Even if it was,  no one can have enough wealth to buy it. 
                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Righteousness is bestowed freely by God. But not everyone receives it. It is given only to those who meet His criteria. 
                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Righteousness starts with the covering or removal of sins through forgiveness. In the old testament covenant, under which the Israelites of old operated, sin was covered or forgiven after the sacrifice of an appropriate animal blood. Even then, it was not everyone who received forgiveness, but only for a specific group. 
                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Anyone who was seen by The LORD to be humble (not arrogant, proud or haughty), and repentant (contrite, remorseful) of their sins, and fearful (obedient) when they hear the word of God, (ref Isaiah 66:2-3, Psalm 1:1-2). Everyone else outside of this group, who did not meet all the three criteria, did not receive mercy. Though, they may sacrifice the fattest bull or lamb with the most blood poured, their sins did not receive forgiveness or mercy of God. In fact, their very sacrifices of bulls or lambs were considered are likened to murdering a man or breaking the neck of a dog, (ref Isaiah 66:2-3).
                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        But the underlying filthy garment of sinful nature was never removed for either group. Hence even Joshua, the high priest, who was perfect according to the standard of man, was still considered filthy. This was why Joshua was still accused by Satan before God, (Zechariah 3:1-5). This was because Joshua still had the garment of unrighteousness or sin on him. It came from Satan, in the garden of Eden, through Adam and Eve, who passed it to every of their offspring. But God in His mercy, removed the filthy garment of unrighteousness from Joshua. It was symbolic of what was to come later through His Son, the Branch.
                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Therefore, whatever is done wearing the old nature, without being covered by God’s righteousness is like filthy rags. This was the situation in the old testament, even in the days of Isaiah and until God sent his son. 
                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Under the new testament or covenant, God offered His own perfect sacrificial Lamb, who came as His begotten Son,  for the forgiveness of sin, (John 1:29, John 1:36).  Not only is sin forgiven through the sacrificial lamb of God, but the very filthy garment, nature of sin or unrighteousness is also removed at the same time. This is why anyone in the Son (the Messiah or Christ) is a new creature, because old things (garments, nature of sin) is gone, and the person becomes new, (2 Corinthians 5:17). 
                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        While righteousness is both free and made available for everyone, under the new testament or covenant, but not everyone has it. Only those in the Son (the Messiah or Christ) receive the righteousness of God through Him. For He is the wisdom from God, the righteousness, sanctification and redemption for every believer, (1 Corinthians 1:30). 
                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Only those who accept the Lamb, the Son of God in their hearts and confess their sins with their mouths, (John 3:16-17, Romans 10:8-10) are righteous before Him. They become born again through the Spirit of God.  For these, the sinful nature and barrier to relationship with God are removed.
                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Under this condition, then rebellion, pride, arrogance, haughtiness, and disobedience to the word of God are done away with. In fact, such a believer operates with humility and total obedience to the word of God.  Self interests or desires are gone. The only desire is to delight God with acts of righteousness. The true believer in essence has become like poured as sacrifice unto God. The believer no longer lives a life of their own, but a life in the Son,  through the Son with the power of the Holy Spirit. 
                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        So, as long as we are wearing the righteousness of God through the Son (the Messiah or Christ), our righteousness or acts of righteousness are Not like filthy rags. But very pleasing, desirable and acceptable like a sweet aroma to God. 
                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The only thing that can make the garment to become defiled or filthy again is a lifestyle of sin and disobedience. It comes when the person chooses to re-wear or put on again, the old nature, the garment of disobedience, sin or unrighteousness from Satan. Then, whatever is done is filthy, no matter how lavish or generous it may be, whether of material, wealth, time, etc.
                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        We also must not be fooled by the increase of blessings (wealth) people enjoy through generous acts of giving. For the promised blessings that come from sowing or giving is universal for all of mankind under the sun on earth, (Genesis 8:22). It is for both believers and non-believers alike, regardless of their faith or religion. But regardless of the rewards from the sowing of seeds, the soul of the unbeliever (or disobedient believer), is doomed for destruction due to the unrighteous garment they are still wearing. It can only be saved through the sacrificial blood of the perfect Lamb of God and remain so through continued obedience to His word.

While Baal was generally worshipped by both males and females, Asherah had a stronghold following among the women, who were encouraged by their men.

They also poured drinks (libation) to appease her,  (Jeremiah 7:18, Jeremiah 44:17-19,  Jeremiah 44:25-27, 1 Kings 16:31-33, 1 Kings 18:18-19, 2 Kings 21:1-9, 2 Kings 23:4-15).

The Israelites through their idolatry practices integrated her images and worship even into the Temple of God, such as in the reign of King Manasseh of Judah, (2 Kings 21:1-7).  This was in direct disobedience to the warnings from God.

        The pagan idolatrous worship and celebration of this mother goddess of fertility , known also as the Queen of Heaven, has been mixed into Christianity, through various disguises.

        Ishstar / Easter vs Passover Celebration: As the goddess of fertility, Asherah or Ishtar, is directly or indirectly celebrated among Christians through Ishtar celebrations. Ishtar is pronounced in English as Easter!. The celebration of Easter has overshadowed and replaced the celebration of Passover, which is the sacrificial death and resurrection of the Passover Lamb of God. In place of Passover, Easter is celebrated. And not surprising, it is filled with bunnies,  hares, rabbits, easter eggs, etc which are all the symbols of the modern female goddess of fertility, Ishtar (Easter).
                                                                                        </Text>

        The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover, as instituted by God, (Exodus 12:1-28, Leviticus 23:5-8, Numbers 9:1-14, Numbers 28:16-25, Deuteronomy 16:1-8). The Passover or Feast of Unleavened bread was celebrated by The LORD and the Apostles,(Luke 22:15, John 13:1-3,  John 2:13-23, Matthew 26:17-28, Mark 14:12-25). 
                                                                                                </Text>

        The pagans non-Jews celebrated Ishtar or Easter. The celebration of Easter has been timed  over the centuries by the Romans to coincide and confuse the celebration of Passover. 
                                                                                                </Text>

        The Passover had always been celebrated by the Israelites. However, there is no celebration known as Easter instituted by God. The Scripture says that King Herod had arrested Apostle Peter during the days of Unleavened bread, the Passover time. This was after he had killed James, the brother of John which pleased the people, (Acts 12:1-3). Herod kept Peter locked up and intended to bring Peter out to be killed after the celebration of Easter! (Acts 12:4). Thus Passover and Easter were celebrated around the same time. But while Passover was known to the Jews, Easter was alien to them, being a pagan festival.  
                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Over the centuries, Easter has been celebrated all over the world among Christians instead of Passover. The Romans brought this into Christianity.  As a result, Easter instead of Passover is popularly marked as the death and resurrection of the LORD. But God instituted Passover not Easter!  Easter is a pagan corruption of Passover. Furthermore, from ancient times till today, Easter is celebrated with bunnies, hares, rabbits, Ishstar or easter eggs, etc It is a continuation of the celebration and global tributes to the ancient mother goddess of fertility, called by several names in different nations, as Asherah, Ashtherot, Ishtar, Easter. What have bunnies, hares, rabbits, easter eggs, egg hunts, etc in Churches got to do with the celebration of the death and resurrection of the LORD? Nothing except to make Easter more fun and acceptable without question. It is a spiritual corruption (a continuation of spiritual adultery or idolatry) of merging the mother goddess of fertility, the Queen of Heaven, with the death and resurrection of the LORD. It has effectively obscured what should be the right celebration, that is the celebration of Passover!
                                                                                                </Text>

        Fabrication Of Queen Of Heaven Into The Church: The ancient idolatrous celebration of the mother goddess of fertility through Ishtar or Easter continues till this day. She is also worshipped as the Queen of Heaven, which God Almighty is completely against as recorded in the Scriptures. Going even a step further in this idolatrous practice, some have replaced or elevated Mary, the Mother of the LORD, to the position of the Queen of Heaven. Mary, like the Apostles and other Saints who died and in paradise, will be resurrected when the trumpet blasts at the coming of the LORD,  (John 11:25-26, Romans 6:5-8, 1 Corinthians 15:19-21, 1 Thessalonians 4:14-17, Revelations 20:4-6, Revelation 20:11-15).
                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        There is no such title or position as Queen of Heaven with God. Beside God Almighty, there has never been and would never be a Mother of Heaven. God Almighty has no consort, God has no wife or consort (unlike the pagan deity or god, Baal). In heaven there is no marriage, (Matthew 22:30). Neither angels, nor God nor resurrected Saints marry or have the need for a wife or husband. No such concept in heaven. 
                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Furthermore, our salvation comes through The LORD, His death and resurrection only and our confession of Him, (John 3:16-17, Romans 10:9-10). Our prayers are answered in His name only, (John 14:13-14, John 15:16, Matthew 18:19, Matthew 21;22, Mark 11:24) . There is no other intermediary between us and God (1 Timothy 2:15, 1 Corinthians 1:30)!  There is no Scriptural basis for  the Queen of Heaven. Furthermore, God has always expressed His displeasure about such an idea. The practice in such churches today is no different from the integration of image of Asherah into the Temple of God by King Manasseh (2 Kings 21:1-7).  Such practice is an extension of idolatrous worship of the ancient Queen of Heaven, which God was and still against,  (Jeremiah 7:18, Jeremiah 44:17-19,  Jeremiah 44:25-27).

He removed Jehoahaz and took him to Egypt, where he was placed in prison till he died, (2 Kings 23:31-34, 2 Chronicles 36:1-4). He then put Jehoiakim as king over Judah.

King Nebuchadnezzar responded by going to attack Judah and Jerusalem in the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim, (2 Kings 24:1). Following the defeat of King Jehoiakim. he was chained to be carried to Babylon, (2 Chronicles 36:5-7).  However, King Jehoiakim continued as the vassal of Nebuchadnezzar and his reign over Judah for eleven years, (2 Kings 24:1-6).  King Jehoiakim himself did not live in captivity in Babylon. However, Nebuchadnezzar collected tribute from the treasury in Jerusalem and took some of the articles from the Temple of God. He also took some members of the royal family  of Jehoiakim, some other nobles of royal descent, along with some of the people from the tribe of Judah as plunders, prisoners and captives to Babylon, (2 Kings 24:1-12, Daniel 1:1-3).

        The little horn, the AntiChrist ruler, will come at the end time and reign for one week of seven years (Daniel 9:27). However, Daniel, received a vision in third year of the reign of King Belshazzar (grandson of Nebuchadnezzar) of Babylon Kingdom. Gabriel had informed Daniel a little horn, a king, would come at the latter end of the Greek Empire (Daniel 8:23). The king will have a fierce (arrogant, aggressive) demeanor, very skillful in deception,  double-dealing, manipulation, and  sinister schemes. He will wield a lot of power and destroy many people, including the holy people. He will be successful and accomplish whatever he wants. Falsehood, lies and deception will become the acceptable norm during his time. He will be full of pride and boastful. He will even pitch himself against The LORD as he takes over the Temple and stops the daily Sacrifices, (Daniel 8:23-26).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        This prophecy was fulfilled, almost 400years after Daniel had prophesied.  The little horn or king was Antiochus IV Epiphanes who ruled as the king of the North from 175-164 BC. Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the eighth in a succession of twenty-six kings from the fourth horn, the Seleucid part, of Greek Empire. Antiochus IV Epiphanes rose to power as he usurped Heliodorus and Demetrius and became the new King. Antiochus gained  influence, power and obtained the kingdom through flatteries.

        When Antiochus IV Epiphanes had become king in 175 BCE, he overthrew Israel's legitimate High Priest Onias III who was of the priestly lineage, as recognized by God and Israel. He was therefore, like a star of heaven, who represented God in leading the Jews on the path of righteousness. Antiochus IV Epiphanes first replaced Onias III with his brother Jason who was himself replaced by Menelaus. But Menelaus was a Benjamite, and a non-member of the priestly Levite family. Thus, Antiochus IV Epiphanes removed the true High Priests of God, replaced him with his own and so brought to end God's divine order of things in His temple. This was equivalent to growing up to the host of heaven, casting down some of the  host and the stars of heaven to the ground, and trampling them as prophesied by Daniel.

        History has it that Antiochus IV Epiphanes plundered and desecrated the holy land and Temple. He was violently bitter against the Jews, and was determined to exterminate them, their religion and worship of God. He devastated Jerusalem, defiled, and prohibited Temple worship. After taking over Jerusalem and the Temple with the help of his military forces, He caused the Temple sacrifices to cease as he took away the regular burnt offering. He issued decrees that forbade Jewish religious practice and completely halted the sacrifices. He outlawed the observances of Sabbath, designated Holy Days and circumcision..

        He compared himself with one of the Greek gods, Zeus and gave himself the surname "Epiphanes" which means "The Illustrious One, The Magnificent One, The visible god".

        Daniel heard a voice asking  “How long will be the duration, when the vision is being fulfilled, regarding the cancellation of the daily sacrifices and the rebellion of desolation (devastation, horror), when both the Sanctuary (Temple) and the host (leading Saints) are to be trampled underfoot?” The answer was given as 2300 morning and evening  sacrifices.

        By 165 BC the Jewish revolt led by Judas Maccabeus against the Antiochus IV Epiphanes and the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Jerusalem Temple was liberated, purified, rededicated with a new altar along with new holy vessels on 25th of Kislev (December 14, 164 BCE). The celebration of Hanukkah every year for eight days was instituted by Judas Maccabeus in 165BC to commemorate this victory over Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The Jews still celebrate Hanukkah to this day.

        A complete fulfillment of this prophecy of a powerful little horn will occur in the future with the coming of the AntiChrist in the end time. Antiochus IV Epiphanes exhibited many traits of the End Time Antichrist. But he is different, and so just a shadow forerunner of the end time Antichrist. The total period when he desecrated the Temple to when it was cleansed was 2,300 days (almost 77months, or more than 6years). The end time Antichrist will commit the abomination of desolation for three and half years. And there is no mention of the cleansing of Temple at the end time Antichrist.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Following the rise and death of Alexander the big horn and king of the Kingdom of Greece, the kingdom was divided into four parts, headed by his four Generals, (Daniel 11:3-4).  For biblical reference, regions are described as North or South relative to Jerusalem. With this in mind, the four Greece regions were: 1). Seleucus (to the North), consisting of Babylon, Persia and Syria   2). Ptolemy (to the South), consisting of Egypt and Palestine,  3) Cassander (to the West) consisting of Macedonia, Greece.  4). Lysimachus (to the East), consisting of Thrace, Asia Minor.  Seleucus also added Asia Minor from Lysimachus to his own. So the Seleucus to the North and Ptolemy to the South of Jerusalem were the two most prominent. 
                                                                                                                        </Text>

        In Daniel 11:6, the daughter referred to was Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy II who was given in marriage to the king of the north, Antiochus II Theos. This was with the hope of bringing peace between the two powers.  To marry Berenice, the King of the North put away his own wife, Laodice,  He later restored Laodice after Bernice lost favor with him.  In revenge for what was one to her, Laodice had her husband poisoned.  She also killed Berenice, her children, attendants and supporters.

They also went on to destroy the Temple, the city of Jerusalem, killed many of the people and sent most of the rest of the people of Judah into exile in 70AD, (Daniel 9:26). The real Judeans / Israelites left Jerusalem desolate for almost two thousand years, since 70AD till 1948AD. During this time, the Romans, their descendants, other Europeans, including the British and others occupied it. As prophesied, the Romans are the people of the little horn prince, the Antichrist, who is to come in the end time, (Daniel 9:26-27).

        Daniel, was one of the first group of hostages taken from Judah into exile in Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. He was taken along with Jehoiakim king of Judah (2 Kings 24:8-12, Daniel 1:1-2). On arrival in Babylon and in the kings service, Daniel consistently refused to be defiled or to sin against God. This was despite opportunities and pressures to compromise. He was thrown into the lion’s den for his faith, but God saved him, (Daniel 6:1-28). He was a great prophet, with the gift of God for the interpretation of dreams. He became the second in command of the Babylon empire and lasted through the end of several kings in the Babylonian empire and into the Medo-Persian empire, (Daniel 1:1-2, Daniel 1:8-14,  Daniel 6:1-28).

        Job lived in the land of Uz in his time. He was blameless and upright. He was someone who feared God and kept clear of anything evil (sinful), (Job 1:1, Job 1:8, Job 2:3). Job underwent an excruciating time of test by the devil to make him sin. Despite losing everything, including all his children, wealth, and position in the society. Despite his severe sickness that followed. Despite pressures from his wife and friends, Job held faithfully unto God. In the end God delivered him. The LORD restored what Job lost.  Indeed the LORD gave Job double of the possessions he had lost. Job lived 140 (one hundred and forty) years.  He lived long enough to see four generations of his descendants: his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren. Job died old, and full of days, (Job 42:10-16).

        There is the Beginning of God, the Beginning of Angels, and the Beginning of the creation of everything else. There is an eternity of time separating them.  
                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        The Beginning Of The Universe:  The beginning spoken of in Genesis 1:1 is of the creation of the Universe, the heavenly bodies, the galaxies, the stars, the earth, the moon, and the things in them. This is the beginning also referred to in John 1:3 and Hebrew 1:2.  When the earth was first created, it was disorderly like a mass of dust and gas, before it became a solid. Then it was empty for a while, covered in darkness before The Holy Spirit began to move over the surface. This led to the creation of the things we see today on the earth. It is within this that human beings, animals (in the sky, on earth, and seas), and the plants were created.
                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Beginning Of The Angels: The Angels also have their own beginning. The Angels, who are all the creation of God, had been created and were existing before the foundation of the earth was laid. The Angels witnessed the creation of the earth. For the morning stars (Angels) sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy when the earth was created, (Job 38:7). If the earth is billions of years old, then The Angels are much older than that. Angels worship and serve God day and night, (though no nights in heaven). Angels are also ministering spirits sent out to minister, caring for the needs of those who will inherit salvation of God, (Psalm 104:4, John 3:5-8, Revelation 14:6-7).
                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        The Beginning Of Beginnings: Then there is the very beginning of beginnings, which goes back to Eternity. It is of God, Elohim, The Creator. No other existed before or bequeathed to God, but He created everything, (Job 41:11). He is the eternal God. He always was, He always is, and He always will be. He has been God from everlasting past and will continue to be to everlasting to come, (Psalm 90:2). At this beginning of beginnings, God The Father, God The Son, referred to as The Word, and God The Holy Spirit had always existed, (Psalm 90:2,  John 1:1-2, John 17:5 and Revelation 19:13). They are One. The Father is like the Architect or Designer of everything. The Son is like the Creator or Builder. The Holy Spirit is the Finisher, the Beautifier of what has been created. The Son shared the same glory with the Father from the beginning, (John 17:5). The Son is the Creator of everything else, (John 1:3, Colossians 1:16). It is through The Son that all things were created,  in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: All things were created by Him and for Him, ( John 1:3, 1 Corinthians 8:6, Colossians 1:16).

        It is impossible for a mere object such as a paper card or a paper airplane or a toy to try to know or fathom the origin of the person who made or designed it. The created object does not have such a capacity. And that is who we are! We are like the mere object and in fact, the Scripture describes us as mere empty breath, (Psalm 144:3-4, James 4:14). It would be impossible for us to understand or fathom the origin of our Creator. This is regardless of how smart we may think we are or what extraordinary abilities we may possess, which The Creator has kindly bestowed on us. A person who is really smart will know the smart thing to do is to stop wasting time on what is totally impossible or unfathomable. He has created us for His own pleasure, (Revelation 4:11, Ephesians 2:10, Ecclesiastes 12:13). The best course of action, when we have this understanding, is to focus on knowing the purpose for which each of us has been created. It is to focus on knowing and fulfilling that purpose for the pleasure of the Creator. It is to fear Him and obey His commandments. This is the conclusion of the wisest man who ever lived, (Ecclesiastes 12:13).

        A New Earth And Universe In The End: The earth as it currently is right now, is polluted with sin and evil of all kinds by human beings. The heavenly (expanse of the sky) is also polluted by Satan and his evil angels who will be expelled down to earth, (Revelation 12;7-9). Then they will stay in hell, and then finally be thrown in hellfire, (Revelation 20:3, Revelation 20:10). Due to these pollutions, there will be the creation of a new earth and a new heaven, expanse of the sky, (Revelation 21:1). However, this new heaven does not include the highest of the heavens where God is, in purity and holiness. This has never and can never be polluted and would not need to be recreated.

        Jealous God: Meaning God is zealously, passionately loving, possessive, while vigilant, guarding, protective over His own, never tolerating unfaithfulness, and as the Almighty God, the Creator and Giver there is no envious jealousy which is evil, (Exodus 20:5, Exodus 34:14, Deuteronomy 4:24, Deuteronomy 5:9, Deuteronomy 6:15, Isaiah 42:8, Romans 8:38-39,Ephesians 3:17-19, Psalm 117:2).

        Satanic or Evil Jealousy: Is the envious, evil kind of jealousy for what he does not have. This is the kind of jealousy Satan has against the elect, the saints or holy people of God, for what God has for them and he cannot have. This was the kind of jealousy Cain had against Abel and murdered him, (Genesis 4:1-12).This kind of jealousy involves contentious rivalry, being negatively apprehensive, vengeful, hateful or insecure out of fear of being replaced by someone else. The sinful carnal nature of the flesh, which came from Satan after the fall of Adam and Eve, exhibits this type of jealousy. Satan did not create or own anything. God the creator of all has no such fear for He created all and cannot be replaced by any other.

        <Text style={styles.header}>[The Commentary] About Past Sins And Generational Curses</Text>
        
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The inherited sin from Adam is the first generational curse on everybody conceived of the seed of man on earth. Sin came to each of us when Adam our forefather fell into sin along with Eve in the garden of Eden, (Genesis 3:6). We partook in committing this as seeds in Adam’s loins. In Adam, God’s righteous nature was exchanged for the sinful carnal nature from the Devil. So we have all been conceived and formed in sin, (Psalm 51:5). So we are brought forth wearing the natural filthy garment of sin, (Zechariah 3:1-5). The only exception of course is LORD Yeshua. He was not conceived of the seed of man, but of the God through the Holy Spirit, (Matthew 1:20, Luke 1:31-35). 
                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Just so that we have no doubt about our sins from birth, the Scripture clearly says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, (Romans 3:23). And sin, results in spiritual death, (Genesis 2:16-17, Romans 6:23, James 1:15).  And spiritual death brings about a gradual decay of the physical body till it dies. So, we are all born, spiritually dead, and live in a physical body that decays to death as a result.
                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Then, added to this may also be a wicked, abominable sin committed by our own parents or their own parents or great grandparents before we were born. It may be for example idolatry, sexual immorality, murder, etc. This brings a curse on who committed it and is passed down to the seed or descendants that come from that line. For the seeds or descendants were in the loins of the previous generation or father who committed that sin. This results in a generation curse, passed down to us. It is the second generational sin. This curse is not just of spiritual death and gradual decay of the body that came through Adam. There may be other manifestations that are peculiar to a particular family lineage. It may be inherited sicknesses, premature death at certain age, continuous failure at point of success, or something else. 
                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        This is what God is saying when He said He punishes the iniquity of the fathers on their children to the third or fourth generation of that family line, (Exodus 20:5-6, Exodus 34:6-7). As long as a sin has not been repented from, then the curse or punishment decreed by God for it remains in effect. 
                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        As long as a child continues in the sinful nature of the father or forefathers, the punishment for the iniquity remains. However, once a sin has been repented of, there is no longer a punishment or curse still attached to it. Each person needs to confess and renounce past sins with their own mouth and receive Yeshua into their heart.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        When a person comes to The LORD Yeshua, confesses his or her sins, all the sins committed or previously recorded against such a person are wiped out. The old sinful nature is removed and is replaced with the righteousness of God that comes through Yeshua, (1 Corinthians 1:30). The person becomes a new person, (2 Corinthians 5:17). All old or present sins, including the first generational sin passed down from Adam, and the second generational sins passed down from the family lineage, as well as own sins committed by the person are forgiven. All the curses attached to those sins are also terminated and replaced with the right standing and blessings that comes from God through His Son. 
                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Scripture assures us that if we confess our sins, including generational sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, (1 John 1:8-10). Not only this. In fact, once God has forgiven a person, He does not remember the past sins counted against that person, (Isaiah 43:25, Hebrews 8:12).
                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        So a person who has repented and confessed past sins is no longer liable for the past generational sins or curses. He will not bear the sins of the father or past generations. But a person who does not repent, but continues in the same lifestyle of the fathers, such a person will continue to bear the consequences of generational sins and curses.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Idols: In general idols are products of human origin. They are carved images, the works of men, being worshipped by humans as a ‘god’. More broadly, anything a person worships, or places their trust or give a higher priority than God Almighty is like an idol or god. It may be carved idol images, animals, human beings such as leaders of some nations, celebrities, wealth, technology, etc. God Almighty is very much against idols of any kind. Carved images or idols are not supposed to be made or worshipped in any form, (Exodus 20:4-5, Exodus 23:13, Isaiah 42:8). This was the main undoing of the Israelites who constantly went for the idols (or gods) of the Canaanites despite repeated warnings from God. References to idols or dead gods in the Scripture will state idols, caved images, vanity, worthless, or works of men, wood, or gods of silver or gold, with eyes but cannot see, mouth but cannot speak, etc. They are not gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. They can and are destroyed at will, (2 Kings 19:18).
                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        They are dead, and do not count before God. Therefore, God Almighty who is living and did not create them cannot be their ‘God of gods’, (Deuteronomy 10:17, Psalm 136:2-3, Daniel 2:47). Then there are those in some parts of the world who take animals as their ‘gods’. Meanwhile, God has given to mankind  the dominion over all animals and the animals as food for mankind, not as ‘gods’, [ref Genesis 1:26, Genesis 9:3]. They too can be destroyed at will. Yet through ignorance and the deception of the evil one, mankind worships animals, stones, woods, silver, gold, etc as gods.  
                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        ‘god’ or ‘gods’: ‘god’ or ‘gods’ in the scripture, are sometimes confused by readers with idols. However, unlike idols, they are in general not of human origin. They are divine heavenly beings or angelic. They are rulers or ‘lords’ with power or authority over some other angelic beings under their domains. Hence the scriptures generally refers to them as ‘gods’, ‘lords’, or as rulers, princes, principalities and powers, with domains. They were created by God through the LORD (His Son) for some purposes. These special heavenly beings belong to Him and are alive in spiritual realms. It is for this reason or in this context that God Almighty is not only referred to as the Most High God, but also as the God of gods, and  LORD of lords, (Genesis 14:18-22, Deuteronomy 10:17, Daniel 2:47, Psalm 136:2-3, Mark 5:7). The Scripture further says the LORD (The Son) is the head of all principalities, the King of kings, and LORD of lords (Colossians 2:10, Revelation 19:15, 1 Timothy 6:15, Ephesians 1:21). These special heavenly beings are also referred to as ‘gods’ or princes (Psalm 82:1, Psalm 138:1, Psalm 97:9, Daniel 10:20-21, Daniel 12:1). They are all subject to the power and authority of the Creator, the LORD, (Colossians 1:16; Colossians 2:15, Ephesians 3:10, 1 Peter 3:22).
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        None of them is ever to be worshipped by human beings. They too are to worship God Almighty, as their creator, just like we do to Him.
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Most of the special angelic beings, rulers, princes, lords are good. Examples include archangels Michael, and Gabriel, (Daniel 10:20-21, Daniel 12:1, Luke 1:11-28). There are also the twenty-four elders or leaders before the throne of God in heaven, (Revelation 4:4). But some of the angelic lords are bad, very bad and have fallen from their estate, due to disobedience, (Genesis 6:2-4, Jude 1:6, 2 Peter 2:4, Revelation 9:13-16).  An example of the bad rulers, lords or ‘gods’ is the prince of Persia with spiritual kings of Persia under him, (Daniel 10:13). Another example are the ‘gods’ of Egypt, which God Almighty said He will execute judgment against (Exodus 12:12). The Judgment is against dead woods, idols or carved images, but against active ‘gods’ in the celestialor angelic realm. Another example is Abaddon or Apollyon (Destroyer), the king of the Abyss, (Revelation 9:11). Another is Lucifer, an anointed Cherubim, (Ezekiel 28:14-28, Isaiah 14:12-14, Luke 10:18).  Lucifer who became known as Satan or Adversary is also referred to as the ‘god’ of this world or prince of the air, (John 14:30,  Ephesians 2:2). These bad rulers or ‘gods’ contend with God to rule over and be worshipped by human beings. They and other bad angels under them therefore organize themselves to oppose everything of God, including the true Saints of God, (Daniel 10:13, Daniel 10:20, Ephesians 6:12, 1 Peter 5:8).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Human ‘gods’. There are ‘gods’ amongst humans, like angelic ‘gods’, Being referred to as ‘god’ in the scripture does not mean they are to be worshipped. But the term ‘gods’ is more of a designation of the special powers given to them by God. An example in the human level was Moses. God made Moses like a ‘god’ to Pharaoh and Aaron as his prophet by giving Moses authority and power over them, (Exodus 7:1).  But Moses was not worshipped by Pharaoh, Aaron or by the Israelites. No human being, regardless of how powerful, is ever to be worshipped.  Apart from Moses, Saints are or will also like ‘gods’, ‘rulers’ or ‘lords’, (Psalm 82:6-7, John 10:34, Revelation 2:26-28). While they may even judge the bad angels and rebuke them, the good angels do not and will come under any judgment and are excluded, (1 Corinthians 6:3).])

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Offering or Giving to God is an act of worship and has been from the beginning, (Genesis 4:1-12). Both Abel and Cain brought their gifts before God. Then Abraham gave a certain proportion, one-tenth or ten percent, of all his spoils from the war to Melchizedek, (Genesis 14:18-19). Melchizedek was the king of Salem and priest of God Most High, who had come with bread and wine, to fellowship with Abraham, and to also bless Abraham.
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        On earth, we sow to reap (Genesis 8:22). This is a sure way God has established for us on earth to increase. Tithing, offering or giving are spiritual means through that we plant or sow and then get the harvest. It is a universal principle for everyone on earth and is not limited to just believers in God. A non-believer who is generous gets blessed back.
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        No one goes to heaven or hell on account of tithing, offering or giving. It is faith in Yeshua The Messiah (Jesus Christ) that takes someone to heaven. However, God is a giver. Therefore, there is no anyone who would not be moved within them to give, if the person claims to be a child of God, has faith in Yeshua and the Holy Spirit is living in the person,.
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        Tithe means one-tenth or ten percent. Under the Old Testament it was a legal number established for the Israelites, the physical descendants of Abraham. Of the tribes of Israel, the Levites worked full time for God. The remaining eleven tribes engaged in farming or business (Numbers 18:21-24). By the eleven tribes each bringing one-tenth, it ensured the Levites had the same amount as the rest, and no tribe was left poor. This was before they arrived and settled in Canaan. 
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        In Canaan, the tithe was still to be paid by the Israelites. But now the tithe was not just for the benefit of the Levites only. Rather, it was also for the benefit of the widows, orphans and poor, as well as for the strangers, and even for the families bringing the tithe, (Deuteronomy 12:6-12, Deuteronomy 14:22-29).  Together, they celebrated and enjoyed it before God. When the Israelites did this, they were then able to go and declare before God, that they had fully obeyed His command in giving their tithes to the Levite, the foreigners, the fatherless (orphans), and the widows, (Deuteronomy 26:12-15).
                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        In the New Testament, Yeshua The Messiah (Jesus Christ) did not teach tithing. But He also did not say people should stop paying tithes or giving. What He said is to give as much as you can, whether as tithe, or offering or just giving with no name attached, (Luke 6:38).  There is no percentage attached in the New Testament. You do it in proportion to your ability. If someone has $10 and gives $2. And if another person has $10million, and gives $1million.  Then before God, the one who gave $2 from $10, has given more than the one who gave $1million. But humans, including Pastors, will make more noise about the one who (in the eyes of God) gave less than you. 
                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Also God does not regard what we give (offering, tithing or giving) and then complaining about. We should not give grudgingly, but happily or cheerfully (2 Corinthians 9:6-10). God prefers an offering, tithing or gift that is given willingly, (Exodus 25:2). That means we should not give beyond the point where we will start complaining or feeling unhappy in your heart. Giving should be voluntary. It should not be by coercion, or trickery, or creating guilt in the minds of people, or ‘bullying’ with harsh words or curses. The same is true of our worship or obedience to God.

        Since giving is a means to sow and reap, a believer should not rob God and so rob himself by not giving, offering or tithing. They should bring these to the storehouse so that there would be food, (Malachi 3:8-12). But the Scripture did not say this food is only for the Pastor and Church workers. Rather it is also for the poor, the widows, the orphans, the strangers and those who have the need for the ‘food or fund’. Pastors who eat it alone or keep the best portion for themselves bring a curse on themselves, (Malachi 1:6-10)

        Now, what the Church receives in offering, tithing or giving is not just meant for the Pastor. It is for five purposes or groups:

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        1): All workers in Church including Pastor, Choir, Musicians, Ushers, Gateman, parking attendants, etc. It includes all who work for the Church. It also include those sent out by the Church on mission work and are not receiving support where they are on mission, (3 John 1:7-8). And no one, including the Pastor should be
        paid more than the average income of members of the Church. Yeshua or the Apostles were not different from those around them. The exemption though was Judas Iscariot who was greedy for money. He was unconcerned about the poor and was stealing money for himself, (John 12:6). He represents leaders who are selfish and greedy for Church money.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        3): The Strangers. There two groups of strangers. The first categories are those in the community that are of a different faith  and do not know the LORD.  Examples are Moslems, Hindus, non-believers, etc. This is powerful evangelism to them because by this act, taste God’s love and goodness and become open to accept Him. The other strangers are those who are new in a community and have not settled down and need help. It may also include traveling evangelists, Gospel or Mission workers.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        4): Church Building Repair, Utility and Other Bills. An adequate or required amount should be set aside for this and other regular on-going Church costs, such as water, electricity, love feasts and uniforms for workers.

        5): Yourself and your family members, including houseboys/girls. This could be through special love feasts organized on a regular basis by the Church.

        If a Church does not operate the biblical principles, then you have the right to distribute your money or goods directly for these purposes as may be required.

        Finally, anything done with the money received by the Church from offering, tithing or giving belongs to all. It belongs freely to everybody including members and non-members or strangers in the community. This includes schools, hospitals, cars, planes, etc acquired with Church money. No one should be prevented or charged to use them!

        YEHOVAH, abbreviated as YHVH, and pronounced 'Yeh-ho-vaw' is The Name of God in Hebrew. The equivalent in English is JEHOVAH  (also pronounced 'Yeh-ho-vaw). (Exodus 3:15, Exodus 6:3, Exodus 34:6).

        Y’AH (or J’AH): God Almighty is also referred to as Y’AH (or YAH) in Hebrew. It is a shortened form of YehovAH. The English equivalent is J’AH or JAH the shortened form of JehovAh, (Psalm 68:4, Isaiah 12:2, Isaiah 26:4, Isaiah 38:11)
                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        .This shortened form Y’AH or J’AH is also used in ‘Hallelu-YAH’ or ‘Hallelu-JAH’, meaning ‘Praise The LORD’, or 'Praise YehoVAH', or 'Praise JehoVAH', (Psalm 104:35, Psalm 105:45, Psalm 106:1, Psalm 106:48, Psalm 111:1, Psalm 112:1, Psalm 148:1, Psalm 149:1,  Psalm 150:1, Revelation 19:3-4, etc).
‘ADONAI’ or 'LORD':  ADONAI in Hebrew is a very popular title of God Almighty. And God has often referred to Himself as ‘ADONAI’. The English equivalent is LORD. It means 'Ruler or Master'.  He is the Creator and Ruler of all, including of divine heavenly beings, principalities, and rulers. Therefore, The Most High God bears as one of His attributes or titles  ‘LORD', 'The LORD', ‘LORD of lords', 'God of gods’, (Deuteronomy 10:17, Psalm 136:2-3, Daniel 2:47. Also refer to commentary explanatory note about ‘idols, gods, and God of gods’ at the bottom of Deuteronomy 10).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        ADONAI or LORD is more often conveniently used in the Scriptures in place of The True Name of God. The origin of this practice goes back to the warning given not to blaspheme, disrespect or use in vain the true Name of God, (Exodus 20:7, Leviticus 24:16).  In fear of this potential misuse and also of mis-pronunciation, subsequent Priests and Hebrew writers substituted the true Name of God (YHVH or YEHOVAH) with ‘ADONAI’ in Hebrew, which translates to mean ‘LORD’ in English. This is why there are more than 7,000 uses of 'ADONAI ' or 'LORD'  in more than 6,000 verses of the Scripture to represent the Name of God in many versions of the Bible. 
                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Some other Hebrew writers have used the word ‘Hashem’  which means ‘The Name’ to represent the true Name of God. But, such a representation is not used in this End Time Bible as God’s Name, Title or Attribute. Rather, ADONAI or LORD are used in this End Time Bible, since they are proper titles God has used for Himself. But where ever ADONAI or LORD is used in this End Time Bible, it is written in uppercase letters. This is to differentiate it from other uses of ‘lord’ for lower lords (master, ruler, or all ‘lords’ other than The LORD, God Almighty).

        Yehoshua  (Yĕshua, Yĕshuw`ah) pronounced Yesh•ü'•ä, in Hebrew, meaning salvation of Yehovah, is  Name of His Son. He is The Messiah or The Anointed One or Savior. He is also known among the Gentiles (non-Jews) as 'Jesus' in English or ‘Iēsous’ in Latin/Greek. He is the creator and head of all principalities and powers, (Colossians 2:10).

        In this End Time Bible, we differentiate between the use of the word ‘LORD’ for God The Father and ‘LORD’ for The begotten Son. The way this has been done is to add ‘Yeshua’ to the word LORD such as ‘LORD Yeshua’  where LORD is used in reference to Him.

        Gog, Magog And Future World Rule:  Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, (Genesis 10:1). The Bible often refers to people through their ancestral lineage. For example, the children, descendants or offspring of Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel, are referred to as Israelites (Genesis 25:23-27, Genesis 32:24-28, Genesis 35:10). Their ancestral line can be traced back through Abraham and then to Shem. Also, the descendants of Canaan, the youngest of the four sons of Ham, were called Canaanites, (Genesis 10:6). They were the founders or original occupiers of the land of Canaan. In the same way, Magog was the second of the seven sons of Japheth, (Genesis 10:1-2). The land or area occupied mostly by his descendants is referred to as Magog.

This will include descendants of Magog, Meshech, Tubal who were sons of Japheth, (Genesis 10:2, Ezekiel 38:1-3).  Also, the descendants of Gomer, another son of Japheth will join Gog.

        Gog and his mighty army will also be joined by other armies from the regions of Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya  (Ezekiel 38:5).  The Persia region includes India, Egypt, Thrace, Europe, North Africa, western Asia, Black Sea, the Caucasus, the Caspian, Jaxartes, Arabian desert, Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean

        Leading this powerful, well organized and equipped world army, Gog will launch a ferocious attack on Jerusalem, Israel, and the people of The LORD, (Ezekiel 38:4-9). The number of Gog's world army will be so numerous, like the sane of the sea. This will happen sometime after the end of the Millennium reign. By then, Satan would have been released at the end of his 1000 years in prison or bottomless pit, (Revelation 20:7-9). Satan will be released for a period to test and deceive the people throughout the whole earth, (Revelation 20:1-3). He will use Gog and Magog to assemble a very powerful world army.

        Gog will conceive an evil plot. The motivation for Gog's army would be hatred for the people of God, to shatter their peace and eliminate them, following the Millennium.  He will also seek to acquire their wealthy possessions which God will bless them with, (Ezekiel 38:10-13).

        They will however fail. For LORD God Almighty will turn the world army of Gog to attack each other. In His fury, the LORD God will also send against them, flooding rain, great hailstones, fire, and brimstone, down from heaven (Ezekiel 38:21-22, Revelation 20:9).

        The Antichrist And Future World Rule. The Antichrist will be different from Gog and in a much earlier era. He will be possessed and empowered by the Satan. He will reign over the entire world, be blasphemous against God Almighty and be worshipped before the second coming of the LORD, (Revelation 13:1-8). He will reign for seven years. He will make himself known with the abomination that causes desolation after three and half years. Then he will reign for another three and half years during which he will severely persecute (in great tribulations) the Israelites and Saints of The LORD in Jerusalem, Israel and all over the world, (Daniel 7:25, Daniel 9:27, Revelation 11:1-2, Revelation 12:6, Revelation 12:14, Revelation 13:5).  He will intensely hate the things of God and overpower the Israelites and Saints of God on earth until God intervenes, (Daniel 7:21-22).

Following this, his master, Satan also known as the dragon, the old serpent, the Devil will be arrested, chained and thrown into hell or the bottomless pit (but not lake of fire) for one thousand years, (Revelation 20:1-3). During that time, The LORD will reign on earth in what is referred to as the 1,000 years or millennium reign of The LORD. The Devil being in prison will not be able to deceive the people on earth.

        After the 1,000 years are over, Satan will be released for a little while to test and deceive the people throughout the whole earth, (Revelation 20:3, Revelation 20:7-9).

        Finally, Satan will be judged and thrown into the lake of fire to join the antichrist and his false prophet, (Revelation 20:10). They will burn there forever and ever.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The phrase “The Day of The LORD” has been used in the Scriptures in three distinct evens that will occur at different times in the end time: #1) The Saints Transportation or Rapture Day of The LORD; #2) The Start of Millennium Day of The LORD; #3) The Judgment Day Of The LORD.
                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Therefore, the Day of The LORD should be understood in these separate contexts where they appear in the Scripture. Let us look at them in the order in which they will occur: 
                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        #1 The Saints Transportation or Rapture Day of The LORD. This can also be referred to as The First Resurrection Day of The LORD. This is when The LORD will suddenly appear in the cloud. The purpose is for The LORD to take the Saints away to heaven, as He has promised, so they could be with Him, ( John 14:3, Matthew 24:30-31, Acts 1:9-11). The day will be a surprise to the believers on earth, (Matthew 24:36-44, Mark 13:32, 1 Thessalonians 5:2, Revelation 3:3, Revelation 16:15).
     </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        He will not come to stay on the earth. This event will happen in the air (atmosphere).The LORD will suddenly appear in the cloud. There will be a very loud blowing of the trumpet (shofar) of God by an archangel, (Matthew 24:30-31, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18). Those who have fallen into sleep (of dead people), who are in The Messiah, will rise up first. This is also referred to as the first resurrection, and it is only for the Saints, (Revelation 20:5-6).  At the same time, in the twinkling of an eye,  those who believe in Him, who are still alive and remain in The LORD, will be taken up (harpazo, rapture, snatch up) together with them in the clouds. They will all go to heaven together with The LORD and be with Him forever, (ref Matthew 24:30-31, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Matthew 22:23-33, Mark 12:18-27, Luke 20:27-40, 1 Corinthians 15:12-23, Daniel 12:1-2, Acts 1:9-11, John 14:3, Matthew 24:36-44, Mark 13:32, 1 Thessalonians 5:2, Revelation 3:3, Revelation 16:15).

        #2 The Start Of Millennium Day of The LORD. This day will also come as a surprise for the world. It will be terrible for the enemies of The LORD like in the past. The Day the flood came was a Day of the LORD in Noah’s time, (Genesis 7:10-12). That was all over the earth. The day Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed was another day of the LORD (Genesis 19: 23-25).

        However, this Day of the LORD coming in the end time is when The LORD will return back to earth with The Saints. He will come back in glory as The Messiah, The King of kings and the LORD of lords, to be the Prince (Ruler) and Priest of God on earth. He will remain physically on earth but in glorious form, along with His Saints. This would be for one thousand (1,000) years or Millennium reign. On that Day, The LORD Himself will arrive with His angels, and the Saints from heaven. The Saints (dead or alive) who have been taken in rapture to heaven, would have finished celebrating the marriage feast of the Lamb. It is the heavenly celebration of Passover, the Holy Union or Communion, the physical togetherness of the LORD as the head and His Saints as His body, (1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, 1 Corinthians 15:51-52, Revelation 19:6-9).

        The LORD will set foot on Mount Olives, (Zechariah 14:1-4, Matthew 24:3, Acts 2:9-12, Luke 21:25-28). There will be the battle of Armageddon to eliminate the armies of the antichrist and false prophet, (Revelation 19:11-21). They stand no chance and will be caught by surprise. The antichrist and false prophet will be captured and thrown into the lake of fire. His millions of army will be destroyed by the sword (word) coming out of the mouth of the LORD. It will include kings (leaders of nations) of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the military commanders, the mighty men, the slaves and the free men. They will be devastated with a major plague sent by the LORD on the wicked people and animals, (Zechariah 14:12-15, Revelation 19:11-21).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        It will also be a day of doom for Satan and his angels who will chained and thrown into hell (not lake of fire). Satan will be captured, bound and imprisoned in the bottomless pit of hell. He will stay there although the millennium reign, (Revelation 20:1-3). 
             </Text>

        After the elimination of the evil and evildoers from earth, and the arrest of Satan, the Devil, then the Kingdom of The LORD on earth will start, (Revelation 20:1-3). At the end of the one thousand years Millennium reign,  Satan will be released for a short while to deceive people. [ref Revelation 19:11-21, Revelation 20:1-3, Revelation 20:7-9). Then there will be another Day of the LORD, which will be followed with judgment. Refer to the commentary at the end of Ezekiel 38 Gog of Magog And The AntiChrist In End Time.

The dead will be judged according to their works, which are written in the books. There will be another book opened, called The Book Of Life. Then Death and Hades (Hell) will be cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.  And anyone whose name is not found written in the Book of Life will also be cast into the lake of fire, (ref Revelation 20:11-15).  On The Judgment Day of The LORD, the heavens will pass away with a loud noise. Every element that makes up the heavenly bodies will be burned up with fire.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees were prominent in Israel in the days of Yeshua The Messiah. 
                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Scribes were the teachers and interpreters of Torah (the five books of Moses, namely Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy). They were well trained and learned as teachers, interpreters and lawyers in the Law of Moses (Mosaic Law) and sacred writings. They provided interpretation to the difficult and subtle questions of the Torah. For this reason, they were also part of the Sanhedrin, and work closely with the priests, the Pharisees and leaders of the people.
                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Pharisees were a sect in Israel, who started after the Jewish exile. They are the fathers of modern day Judaism. They believe in the Old Testament, along with Jewish oral traditions, beliefs and way of life. The Pharisees believe in the existence of good, evil, angels and demons, and in the coming of The Messiah. The Pharisees believe in the resurrection of the dead, existence of hell, fire and reward for each person according to his individual deeds. They seek for praise through outward observance of external rites and forms of religious devotions such as ceremonial washings, fasting, prayers, and alms giving. They mingled with the common people while taking advantage of them. They prided themselves on their good works, which they publicly advertise for all to see. They tell people to do what they themselves will not do. They enjoyed placing heavy burdens and demands on people. They did all their works of the commandments as a show off in public, to be seen and praised by all people. They loved to wear on their arms extra large prayer patches (phylacteries) with passages of Torah written in them. Also, they wore robes with extra long tassels. They took the extra effort to make them conspicuous so that they will look more pious than the other people about the law of God. They loved the high tables and places of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues. They loved being greeted in the marketplaces, and addressed as ‘Rabbi, Rabbi’ by the people, (Matthew 23:3-8). 
                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Yeshua The Messiah also further spoke of the multiple sins of the Scribes and Pharisees, their hypocrisy and double standards, pretenses, focus on the outside while the inside if filthy, focus on smaller things and ignoring what really matters, false teachings, wickedness, bloodsheds of the righteous and prophets, persecutions the Saints, etc (Matthew 23:13-36).
                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        The Sadducees (meaning "the righteous") were a religious party among the Jews. They were wealthy, hated the common people, and were opponents of the Pharisees. They did not believe in traditions. They believed in Torah as written, and only as it relates to faith and moral conduct. Unlike the Pharisees and Scribes, the Sadducees did not believe in resurrection of the body, immortality of the soul, the existence of spirits and angels and future judgment because they were not covered in the Torah. They also denied the oral laws, the prophets and psalms as revelations of God.
                                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Yeshua The Messiah chastised the Sadducees for their lack of knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures or the power of God. He used the scripture to teach them about the resurrection of the dead, and also why there is no marriage, no one will marry or be given in marriage after resurrection, (Matthew 22:23-33). 
                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        The Essenes came as a third option to the Pharisees and Sadducees. They moved out of Jerusalem, fearing the corruption of the Pharisees and Sadducees. They lived a secluded lifestyle in the desert. They taught righteousness, adopted strict dietary laws and a commitment to being eunuchs and celibacy, (Matthew 19:7-12). Not much is written about the Essenes in the Scriptures.
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        The Herodians were followers of Herod. They were mentioned in the Scripture and always in conjunction with the Pharisees (Mark 3:6, Mark 8:15, Mark 12:13, Matthew 22:16). The Herodians were a political party and a sect of Hellenistic Jews. Their objective was to restore a Herod to the throne in Judea as well as in other areas ruled by Herod the Great. Like the Pharisees, they severely opposed Yeshua The Messiah, and plotted together to have Him killed.

        God is love. He is the God whose love is so wide, long, high and deep and cannot be fathomed. He manifested His love for us through His only begotten Son by sending Him to come and die for us, so that we might live through Him. The gospel of good news brought by Yeshua from God is rooted in love. He wants us to also show that love to others. Every believer in Yeshua must love. Whoever does not love is not born of God and does not know God, (John 3:16, 1 John 4:7-12, Ephesians 3:18).

        It is His desire for us to have abundance of peace. Yeshua is the prince of peace. He gives peace, the like of which, no one else can give, (Isaiah 9:6, John 14:27). 
                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Despite these, Yeshua has warned that His coming is not all for peace on earth. Rather, it will kindle fire on earth. The fire of conflict, division and hate even within the family. He said the father will be divided against son and son against father; the mother against daughter and daughter against mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, (Matthew 10:34-39, Luke 12:49-53).
                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The reason for this is because not everyone will accept Him or accept God as their LORD! If everyone in a family were to accept the lordship of The Messiah or God in their lives, there will be no conflict or division amongst family. But opposition to the things of God comes when people do not accept Him. Those who do not accept Him will oppose those who do. This will inevitably bring about conflict, hate and division within the family, between parents and children, between siblings, and between neighbors and friends. In some cases, it can bring about persecution, rejection or even death of the believer. This is the fire and division Yeshua says His coming brings to earth. 
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        God has given each person the freedom of choice. Following The Messiah and obeying God is a choice each person must make. There will be some who choose to follow and obey God.  There will be some who will choose not to follow or obey Him. For this reason, conflict, tension, division will arise between the peoples on the opposite side of the choice. When people are on the opposite sides of this choice, conflict may arise between pleasing God or pleasing people. Conflict may arise between following human traditions and obeying what God says in His word. 
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        Hate, rejection and persecution may arise against a believer because he has decided to follow The Messiah and obey God. Those who reject The Messiah are inevitably against Him and His followers. They are on the side of the Devil. With the Devil comes hate and even death. Just as the Devil comes to steal, kill and destroy, his followers are prepared, if possible, to destroy the follower of The Messiah and God, (John 10:10). They are known by their fruit, whether they are of God or of the Devil, (Matthew 7:16, Matthew 7:20).
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        Yeshua also said if anyone follows Him as The Messiah, and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, and even his own life also, he cannot be His disciple! He said such a person must completely deny himself, take up his cross and follow Him, (Luke 14:25-27, Matthew 10:38-39, Matthew 16:24-26, Mark 8:34-38, Luke 9:23-27). He said whoever loves his father or mother more than Him is not worthy of Him. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than Him is not worthy of Him. In other words, the love for God must take first place over and above all else. It must be more than the love for the family. There must be self-denial, death of self and giving up of self, family and what the person loves or treasures. 
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        To “hate one’s family” is not and never to be violent against anyone. It is also not and never to hold resentment, hate, grudge or unforgiveness against anyone. For those who harbor resentment or violence in their hearts are not of God!  And those who refuse to forgive will not receive forgiveness from God, (Matthew 6:14-15). God is love, and a believer in The Messiah who follows God must show love all the time. To love God is to completely listen, obey Him, and live according to His word, (John 14:15). It is to put Him and His word above all else and be prepared to reject all others if and when a conflict arises. 
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        To “hate one’s family” is to love God more than them. It is to be prepared to reject, disobey, refuse, ignore, disagree, or completely walk away from them if their ideas, requests, desires, practices, customs, traditions are in conflict or contradiction against the word of God.  
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        To “hate one’s family” is to hate and reject the bad habits of a person and not the person! The believer is still to love them and show them God’s love. The believer in The Messiah has to make a hard choose between obeying God or pleasing the family when there is a contradiction!  To “hate one’s family” is for the believer in The Messiah, to make a decision against pleasing the family outside of God’s command! 
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Every true believer in The Messiah must continue to show God’s love and pray for others, for their salvation. God does not want anyone to perish but to come to the knowledge of His love and salvation through His Son. Every believer must have this mindset!  But there is one limit to showing God’s love to others. The love must not go beyond the point where the believer will have to compromise in his obedience to God, and so loss his own salvation and soul. God does not desire for any soul to perish or go to hell. The believer must therefore, first save his own soul by living in the righteousness of God and total obedience to Him. Then the believer must extend God’s love to others and labor in that love to save other souls from perishing. This is by continuing to share the good news of God’s kingdom and leading them to also know and live in God’s righteousness and obedience to God. Where this is not physically possible or it puts the salvation of the believer in potential jeopardy, then the believer should just pray for them, wherever he is, away from them. God will raise somebody else as a messenger to them because of His love and the believer’s prayers to God for them. And always remember, a human being can preach to another, but no human being has the power to convert another one to follow The Messiah. It is the Holy Spirit that does every true conversion and seals the believer.

        <Text style={styles.header}>[The Commentary About Matthew, Mark And Minor Differential Emphasis of Details]</Text>
        
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        There is little or no difference, except in areas of emphasis, between the accounts of Matthew, Mark and Luke.  Apostle Matthew was the writer of the Gospel of Matthew. He was originally a tax collector before accepting Yeshua into his life, (Matthew 9:10-13, Mark 2:13-17).  Then he became one of the disciples and an Apostle, (Matthew 10:1-4, Mark 3:13-19).  Apostle Matthew was thus a first eye witness of what happened.
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        John Mark, was the writer of the Gospel of Mark. He was the son of a widow named Mary (Acts 12:121-17). Mary’s home was a meeting place for the disciples to fellowship and pray. While Mark was not one of the twelve disciples, his closeness to them enabled him to gather much information from the disciples.  John Mark later accompanied Paul and Barnabas on their missionary journeys, (Acts 12:25).
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The accounts of the scenes, purposes, actions and outcomes of the events given by Matthew and Mark were exactly the same. They collaborated each other. Occasionally, and only in a few cases, did they have differences in areas of emphasis of the same event. There are six such places that can be observed in the books of Matthew and Mark where such occurred. They are explained below for greater understanding. 
                                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        #1 Lawful To Do Good or Not on Sabbath (Matthew 12:10, Mark 3:4, Luke 6:7-9): Matthew stated the people asked Yeshua (Jesus, Iēsous), “Is it permissible by the Law (Torah) to heal on the Sabbath?”.  Their purpose was to lay a trap with which they could accuse Yeshua.  The account of Mark stated Yeshua said to the people: “Is it permissible by the Law (Torah) to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill on the Sabbath?” The questions were both the same in both accounts. 
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Luke reported that the Scribes and Pharisees were closely watching Yeshua to see if He would heal on a Sabbath. They were looking for an opportunity to accuse to Him. So Yeshua knowing their thoughts, turned around to ask them the question, (Luke 6:7-9). He knew the question in the minds of the people, some silently voicing it. So He was in essence rhetorically echoing  or asking back the question before He went on to answer it. 
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        However, and more importantly, the scene, purpose, action, teaching and outcome were both the same in both the accounts of Matthew and Mark.
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        #2 Casting Out Of Legions Of Demons in Gadarenes (Matthew 8:28-34, Mark 5:1-17, Luke 8:26-39):  Matthew had direct personal experience working with The LORD as a disciple and an Apostle. There has been a lot of confusion on this as to whether there were two men or just one man possessed by demons and delivered by Yeshua. 
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Both Mark and Luke mentioned of a man that came out to meet Yeshua. Their report contained the word ‘a man or the man’. They continued their report on this man and the legions of demons that were cast out from him. 
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        At the beginning of  Matthew’s account, he used the word ‘two’. Then in the same verse, Matthew went on to add “possessed with demons, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no one could pass through that way“, (in Matthew 8:28).  Matthew may have been referring to two men, and many readers have assumed and interpreted it as such. However, unlike his reports about people in other areas, here he did not use or add the word ‘men’, ‘two men or people’. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The word ‘two’ may also be referring to the dual or double situation here. For in all the deliverances of demon-possessed people by Yeshua as reported in the Scriptures, this was the only case reported of not just being demon-possessed but also extremely fierce and dangerous to the people around. This may be what Matthew was referring to. That is, a combined dual, two, twain situation of one being ‘both’ demon-possessed and extremely fierce. The word interpreted as ‘two’ here, without the word ‘men or two men’ , could also have meant ‘both”. That is the presence of ‘duo’, ‘dual’ , ‘two’ or ‘twain’ situations. Such as one being ‘both’ demon-possessed and extremely fierce. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Also, in the rest of the Matthew’s account of this deliverance from Matthew 8:29-34, the word ‘two men’ or ‘men’  or ‘man’ were never used! Instead, Matthew immediately began and continued to use the word ‘us’, or ‘they’ to represent the unusual presence of multiple demons. For example in Matthew 8:29, it says ‘they cried out…. Saying have you come to torment us before the time’. This was clearly of the multiple demons speaking, and pleading their case with Yeshua. Both Mark and Luke also confirmed there were multiple demons, which spoke and pleaded together that they should be sent to the herd of swine. Mark and Luke also used the word ‘a man’, ‘the man’ to indicate there was only one man, whose body had been the home to the legions of demons.

        So Matthew in his opening sentence on this account, informed us of the dual presence or situation of being both demon-possessed and extremely fierce. And the accounts of Mark and Luke helped in further clarifying for us to understand there was just one man, who was both demon-possessed and extremely fierce with legions of demon. In that case, both Matthew, Mark and Luke were all in perfect agreement, filling in the missing gaps, as they did in many other reports.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Again, and more importantly, in the accounts each by Matthew, Mark and Luke of the casting out of legions of demons in Gaderenes, the scene, purpose, action, and outcome were all the same. This is what is more important to believers. And Yeshua had the power to and could have done this to one, two, three or a crowd of people all demon-possessed at the same time.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        #3 Walking stick or Rod for Journey (Matthew 10:10,  Mark 6:8): When Yeshua (Jesus, Iēsous) was sending out the twelve disciples on evangelism in the surrounding towns, He instructed them on how they should go, what to take or not take. In the account of Matthew, they were not to take “extra change (but just one) of clothes, shoes, or walking sticks (staff, rod like shepherd’s)”. The account of Mark stated “except a walking stick”, meaning not more than one walking stick or staff. Both accounts agree with each other. In both accounts, not more than one shepherd-like staff or rod was allowed of them. Again the scene, purpose, action, and outcome were both the same in both the accounts of Matthew and Mark.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        #4 The special request for James and John the Sons of Zebedee (Matthew 20:20-24, Mark 10:35-41): Matthew gave more details on the participation by the mother of the sons of Zebedee, on this request for the benefit of her two sons. The request related to both her sons James and John, who were also disciples. Mark focused on just James and John, the two disciples involved and with whom the other disciples were displeased. Mark ignored the part of the mother, who initiated it. In the accounts of both Matthew and Mark, the two disciples 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        James and John participated in the making of this request to Yeshua (Jesus, Iēsous). They both confirmed their willingness to do whatever it takes, (Matthew 20:22, Mark 10:38-39). The scene, purpose, action and outcome remained the same as reported by both. The mother of James and John, whose name was Salome, was a very faithful follower of Yeshua, along with other women, who ministered to their needs till the very end. She was with the other women during the death on the cross and resurrection of Yeshua, (Mark 15:40, Mark 16:1).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        #5 The healing of the blind men in Jericho (Matthew 20:29-34, Mark 10:46-52, Luke 18:35-43): The accounts of Mark and Luke were both focused on the blind man who was healed as Yeshua was entering into Jericho, (Mark 10:46, Luke 18:35). The blind man’s name was given as Bartimaeus in the report of Mark. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        On the other hand, the account of Matthew was focused on two blind men who were healed after Yeshua had entered and was leaving Jericho for Jerusalem, (Matthew 20:29). The blindman, named Bartimaeus, was sitting and begging at one end of the city, the entry way taken in by Yeshua and His disciples. They were coming from the Jordan end. The other two blind men were on the other end of the city, the side leading to Jerusalem where Yeshua was headed. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Again, the focus is not the number of blind men. The key thing, which is most important, was that the blind was healed as confirmed by both Matthew, Mark and Luke that the healing of the blind took place. In both cases, the blinds who desperately needed the healing, shouted on top of their voices and refused to be silenced or intimidated by the crowd. Again the scene, purpose, action, and outcome were both the same in both the accounts of Matthew and Mark.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        #6 The Donkey and the Colt for the Triumphant Entry into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:2-11,  Mark 11:2-10): While Matthew mentioned both the donkey and her colt (young donkey) together, Mark focused on just the colt.  Mark’s account does not negate or disprove the existence of two donkeys, the mother donkey and the young colt. Yeshua rode on the colt that had not been ridden on before. Again the scene, purpose, action, and outcome were both the same in both the accounts of Matthew and Mark. The important thing was The Messiah triumphantly rode on a donkey into Jerusalem and fulfilled the prophecy by Zechariah, (Zechariah 9:9).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        About Hundredfold Father, Mother, Sisters And Brothers: First, let us understand, who is a family. In the strict sense, a family member is one related by blood. In other cases, they may be family through marriage or adoption. Every believer in The LORD has been reborn (redeemed) by the Blood of the LORD Yeshua Himself. All believers have thus become related and members of one big family in the Kingdom of God. God is the father, who is a hundred times more than any other earthly father. He is the father for all believers in Yeshua The Messiah.

                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Secondly, Yeshua also clearly explained who is His brother, sister or mother. One time, His earthly blood mother and blood brothers came looking for Him while He was preaching the gospel. He stopped, looked around the people and explained to them He already had his mother and brothers around there with Him. “For whoever does the will of God is My brother, My sister and mother”, (Matthew 12:46-50, Mark 3:31-35). 
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Thirdly, while He was on the cross, He told Mary His mother: “Woman, look! Your son!”.  At the same time, He also said to the disciple (John) “Look! Your mother!” And from that time on, the disciple took her to his own home, (John 19:26-27). They had become one family through The LORD.  
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        So, every believer in the LORD already has more than a hundred fold gain of brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife or children This is whether they still have their earthly families with them or not.. The desirable thing is for the blood family members to join this bigger family by coming under Yeshua The Messiah as LORD and savior. Even where there has been no physical loss, there is still a gaining of a more than a hundred fold of new family members.
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        Now, there are actually those who have lost their earthly families of brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife or children. The LORD in the Scripture already explained this could and would happen. A person may through devotion to the gospel suffer loss of contact with families; Or has no family home to go to back to because of constant moving around (Matthew 8:20); Or his or her family may be killed through persecution; Or may through rejection by relatives, be cut off or become an outcast by parents or other family members or relatives. Clearly, the person cannot get back to those members of his family or household he is related to by blood. Yeshua warned that His coming will bring about a conflict, rejection, separation between families members as some will accept or oppose, (Matthew 10:35-38, Luke 12:51-53). The desirable thing is for the blood family members to also accept Yeshua The Messiah as Lord and savior. Then they can continue as one in Him. God does not want anyone to perish (John 3:16, 2 Peter 3:8-10).
                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        Those who have lost physical or earthly family gained more than one hundredfold reward by remaining with the body of believers in The LORD, and in fellowship. They gain new family brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife or children in The LORD. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        In the example of the early disciples and believers, they came together as one family, new brothers and sisters, sharing everything together as one, (Acts 2:44-46, Acts 4:32-35).  They had fellowship together, and freely moved among each others. Every believer gains this new family of brothers, sisters, of believers as one in the LORD, with God as the father. This is much bigger, than those who are family members by human blood. This is how it should be seen in the body of The LORD. Not just in a small Church with few members, but looking at the bigger body of The LORD.
                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        Possessions, lands and properties: The silver, the gold, all of heavens and earth belong to God (Haggai 2:8, Psalm 24:1, Psalm 115:16, Isaiah 66:1). He is more than able to reward each person more than a hundred fold of their losses for the Kingdom of God. But He also said, what will it profit a person if he gains the whole world and loss his soul, (Matthew 16:26, Mark 8:36-38). He said sell what you have and give to the poor. He further said, everyone should lay up their treasures in heaven where there is no moth, rot or thieves, and where your treasure is where your earth is (Matthew 6:19-21, Luke 12:33-34).  He told the rich man, if you want to be perfect, go and sell all your possessions, give them to the poor, come, take up your cross and follow Me (Matthew 19:21, Mark 10:21). He said, it will be difficult for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God, and even more so for them than for a camel to pass through the hole of a needle, (Mark 10:23-25. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        While He wants us to be rich and fully provided for, He emphasizes contentment and His ability to meet our daily needs, and our sharing with the poor. His teaching about the Kingdom of God is not of poverty. But of being well provided for. Neither is it about accumulation of materials, wealth and possessions. But it is of sharing. It is of being a conduit, a channel for God’s blessings to flow and be shared with those who have the need. As an example, He did not accumulate wealth while on earth. Also none of His disciples, apostles or early believers accumulated wealth, houses, properties, etc. Indeed, they could have taken advantage of their great miraculous, healing or even prophetic powers to accumulate wealth for themselves from the people. But they chose to be like the others, shared whatever they had with them, while laying up treasures in heaven. This is the model for every true believer. The present global accumulation of riches in the churches by leaders using God endowed miraculous or prophetic powers, or accumulating wealth through seeking for donations, tithes and offering is alien to the Scripture! They are no better than the girl possessed with spirit of divination who brought much wealth to her master until Paul put an end to it, (Acts 16:16-18). They are not better than prophet Balaam (Numbers 23-24) who used his power to gain wealth. They are not better than Gehazi the greedy servant of Elisha the miracle working prophet of God, (2 Kings 5:20-27). Neither are they better than the Pharisees or Scribes who twisted the gospel and used their positions as leaders to accumulate much wealth for themselves, (Matthew 23:3-8, Matthew 23:13-15).

        In the early Church, there was great love. The believers had all things in common. In a single Church location they shared all together. When they moved to another place they still had access. The Apostles and believers traveling around did not have to acquire houses and properties. They simply went to the home of another believer and stayed with them. And there could be hundreds, if not thousands of such believers homes and properties where believers have such joint access. Believers open up their homes and possessions to other poorer believers. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        Believers are promised eternal life and mansions in heaven. Indeed, there are many mansions in heaven, enough for all believers, (John 14:2). And everyone who makes it to heaven become like an Angel, (Matthew 22:30, Mark 12:25, Luke 20:35-36). Therefore, people who see themselves owning many mansions in heaven is an extension of their human values or expectation. It has no place in Heaven. What is the purpose or need for people need to accumulate mansions, houses or properties in heaven(like on earth)? It is ridiculous. Its is trying to transfer human, earthy value system into heaven! For Angels do no accumulate any of these. The Kingdom of Heaven is one big family of God, all united.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        Accumulation on earthy is an insurance against when supply runs out. But in heaven, they have no need to accumulate material, possessions, or food as humans do on earth. This is because in the Kingdom of God, He makes everything available to them if and at the instant they need anything. They never lack anything. The LORD gave us a little glimpse of that while He was on earth, He never accumulated. He simply asked The Father for whatever He needed, whenever He needed something. And in heaven, nothing is lacking, and even if there is, the Father is right there to provide instantly (before one asks)! If in heaven  they never lack anything and if what God has is available to them at anytime they ever have the need, then there is no need to accumulate. Since there is never lack of anything they need from the Father, they have no need to accumulate (as insurance for when it finishes). For in the angelic state, they can move around, at great speed, to anywhere, and stay anywhere  (if necessary).  If they eat or change clothes as we do, (which is doubtful), they can do any of these at will, at anytime, automatically, without the need for wardrobes or pantries or storage barns for accumulation.

        On the day of The LORD, the sun that gives light to the earth will be darkened. The moon that also gives light to the earth will not give its light. There will be actual darkness for a day on the earth, (Isaiah 24:23, Zechariah 14:6-7, Matthew 24:29, Acts 2:20).
                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        The Messiah in His revelation and prophecy also said that Stars will fall from heaven, and the heavenly powers will be shaken, (Matthew 24:29). This statement is part a metaphor and part literal.

        A small asteroid or rock falling from the sky to the earth would cause a major destruction. As for stars, there are billions, countless number, of them in the sky. They are each much bigger than our sun, moon or earth. One or some of the stars falling to the earth will shatter the whole earth into small pieces. The Messiah is coming back to the earth. The people on earth will see Him, and He will rule over all the earth as King and Priest of God.
                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        Therefore, stars falling from heaven are not literal stars. Rather the statement of ‘stars falling from heaven’ is a metaphor referring to divine heavenly beings, who will fall down from their lofty positions in heaven. Prophet Isaiah spoke about Satan’s fall, saying ‘How you have fallen from heaven, you son of the Dawn, O Lucifer. How you are thrown down to the earth’, (Isaiah 14:12).  The literal meaning of Lucifer is ‘Light bearer, shining one, morning star’!
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The stars falling from heaven in the end time will include Satan, and other bad angelic principalities, powers, and rulers in heavenly places, (Ephesians 6:12, Daniel 10:13). They would fight to remain in the heavenly realms but will be defeated and thrown down, fall down to the earth, (Revelations 12:7-9). As they fall from their domains or positions of power, the powers of heaven, rulers or ‘gods’ will be shaken and not be like before. (Also Refer to the commentary explanatory note about ‘idols, gods, and God of gods’ at the bottom of Deuteronomy 10).
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>                                                                                                                                                          
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The LORD, The Messiah, once told His disciples He beheld Satan falling like lightning from heaven, (Luke 10:18). In the end time, Satan will further be bound with chain and thrown down into the bottomless pit, (Revelation 20:1-3). The bottomless pit or hell will be his prison for one thousand years, before the Millennium reign of the LORD on earth. It is the initial place, before going to lake of fire, for all fallen stars or divine beings, who have violated their first estate.
                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        Prophet Isaiah also said:  ‘The LORD will punish in heaven above the ‘gods’ (divine heavenly beings, angelic), And on the earth the kings of the earth. They will be rounded up together, as prisoners are rounded in the pit. They will be put in the prison. And finally, they will be punished, (Isaiah 24:21-22). Ultimately, they will later end up in the lake of fire, that had been prepared for them, (Revelation 20:10, Matthew 25:41, Jude 6, Revelation 20:11-15).

        The antichrist is not one of the stars of heaven or divine heavenly being. He will start initially as a man of sin, who will become adopted by Satan for his use.  He will go straight into lake of fire along with the false prophet, (Revelation 13:3-8, Revelation 19:20).

        Thirty pieces of silver shekels weighed about 0.75pounds, (340.2grams). In those days, each Jewish male over 20 years paid half-shekel for The Temple Tax, for the maintenance of the Temple. This was equivalent to a two day’s salary. So, 30 shekels was equivalent to 120 days’ salary. The money was also large enough to buy a large field, Potter’s Field, as cemetery for the burial of foreigners, (Matthew 27:1-8).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        One of the major events that happened during the death and resurrection of Yeshua The Messiah was the resurrection of the Saints, (Matthew 27:52-53). He is the resurrection and life and holds the keys of death and hell, (John 11:25, Revelations 1:18).
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        While He was on the cross, He cried with a loud voice the second time and released His spirit. Some events followed this. First, the Temple Veil was torn from top to bottom. There were two veils or screens. There was the outer veil or screen called the Temple Veil. It separated the Tabernacle from the main Temple area where the Altar of burn offering was, (Exodus 26:36, Exodus 40:28-30). The second veil or screen was within the Tabernacle. The Tabernacle had two sections, the Holy Place and The Most Holy Place, that were separated by the second veil or Screen,  (Exodus 26:31-35, Exodus 40:21). The Scriptures only mentioned the Temple Veil being torn.
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        While the Temple Veil being torn, there was also earthquake and the splitting of rocks in Jerusalem. In addition, the graves were opened. 
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Yeshua The Messiah was the first fruit to be raised from the dead with immortality, (1 Corinthians 15:20-23,  Revelation 1:5, Luke 24:39).  Then after His own resurrection, many bodies of the Saints that were dead were also raised from the dead. They were seen by the people in Jerusalem city, because they appeared to many, (Matthew 27:50-53). 
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Scripture does not say if other cities also had the bodies of the dead Saints raised to life, as in Jerusalem. During His ministry on earth, The Messiah raised many people bodily, from the dead, and they lived with their families. If the Saints whose bodies were brought back to life were all of that generation, and had no immortality in the manner of  Lazarus, then it is conceivable they went to be with their families, (John 11:1-45). Then they would live in their bodies until their death. 
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        However, the Saints were some of the multitude of captives set free from Satan by The Messiah. The Scripture tells us that The Messiah led the captives captive when He ascended on high. Their souls await the time of the sound of the trumpet call of God. Then the dead in The Messiah will rise first, and their souls will be reunited with glorious bodies.  Those who are alive in Him, will join them and be caught up together in the air with The Messiah, (1 Thessalonians 4:15-17,  1 Corinthians 15:51-52).
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Until the death and resurrection of The Messiah, the souls of the Saints who died were held in a paradise below the earth. The souls of the unrighteous were also below in hell, in a separate compartment. They could see and communicate with each other, but could not help or change their status, (Luke 16:19-31)
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Also from after the resurrection of The Messiah, when any Saint dies, the soul no longer goes to a paradise in the lower part of the earth. Rather the soul of the righteous goes to the paradise in the heavens above, to await the resurrection of the body, (Revelation 6:9-11, 2 Corinthians 5:8, Philippians 1:21-24, Hebrew 12:22). 
                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        As for the unrighteous, they will continue to go to hell, below the earth, where they are held until their own resurrection for judgment, (Revelation 20:11-15).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Elijah and John the Baptist were different prophets for different times. But they had similar kind of assignment and operated with the power of the same Spirit. They have special ministry to do with the coming of the Messiah. There are two comings to the earth of The Messiah. Each of these two comings have a messenger to herald and prepare the way. This is the assignment of John The Baptist and Elijah.
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        His first coming of The Messiah was as The Lamb of God. He was to come, suffer, be killed, and rise up from the dead on the third day, (John 1:29, John 1:36, John 3:16-17, Luke 24:44-47). He repeatedly told His disciples about this, ( Matthew 16:21, Mark 8:31, Luke 9:22, Matthew 17:22, Mark 9:30-31, Luke 9:44-45, Matthew 20:18-19, Mark 10:33-34, Luke 18:31-34).  
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The purpose of this first coming was to bring about repentance, forgiveness of sin and salvation to the world, (John 3:16-17, Luke 24:47).  
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Ahead of this first coming of the Messiah, a messenger was to be sent as prophesied in the Scriptures. The role of the messenger was to prepare the way, to warn the people. He was the herald, the announcer. He was to come ahead and prepare the people. (Isaiah 40:3, Malachi 3:1, Matthew 3:3, Mark 1:2-3, John 1:23).  John The Baptist was the messenger ahead of the first coming of The Messiah as Sacrificial  Lamb of God. He lived a secluded life in the wilderness. After many centuries of no prophets in Israel, He was born and then rose as the  lonely voice in the wilderness. He rose to announce through his preaching of the arrival of the Messiah, who will save the world from sin. He baptized, (totally immersed, dipped inside, submerged), the Messiah and revealed Him to the Israelites. 
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        There is an interval between the first and second coming of The Messiah. After the first coming of the Messiah, and having accomplished the purpose of salvation for the world, He would go back to heaven and stay for a while. Then at the appointed time, He will come back again, the second time. This time would not be as the sacrificial Lamb of God, but as The King of God to reign on earth. He will reign and rule on earth as The King of kings and LORD of lords, (Revelation 19:11-21). He will both King and Priest of God on earth (Zechariah 6:12-13). The day He appears would be The Day of The LORD on earth. For He comes to put an end to sin, and would eliminate the rebellious, the disobedient, (Zechariah 14:1-4). It will be a day of doom for the antichrist, his false prophet and millions of their soldiers on earth, (Revelation 19:19-21).  It will also be a day of doom for Satan and his angels who will chained into hell, (Revelation 20:1-3). Refer to the commentary at the end of Zechariah 14 About The Day Of The LORD in End Time.
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Like the first coming, His second coming will be specially heralded by messengers. This time, there will be two messengers. One of them would be Prophet Elijah, (Malachi 4:6, Revelation 11:3-4, Zechariah 4:11-14, Matthew 11:10-15, Matthew 17:10-11). Elijah was around during the time of Ahab and Jezebel, (1 Kings 17:1-24, 1 Kings 18:1-40). He had defeated the false prophets led by Jezebel and brought revival to Israel. Prophet Elijah did not die, but was parted from Elisha his servant and then taken away in a chariot, (2 Kings 2:11-12). He was taken away but will come back to play a major role as a messenger ahead of the second coming of the Messiah in the end time. Elijah and Moses appeared and discussed with The LORD Yeshua during the transfiguration, (ref Matthew 17:1-9, Mark 9:2-10, Luke 9:28-36). Apart from Elijah, the other prophet who did not die as reported in the Scriptures was Enoch, (Genesis 5:24). He was of the first world or generation, which started with Adam and was destroyed in the flood in Noah’s time. Whether it is Enoch or Moses or one of the Apostles of the LORD or someone else who joins Elijah would be as determined by the LORD, who knows what is best in He plans.
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The purpose of Elijah and of the other messenger in the end time would be like that of John the Baptist. His purpose is to prepare the Israelites, who had rejected Him when He first came. His purpose is to help them avoid the fierce anger and judgment of God, through getting them to repent and accept The Messiah. 
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        When The Messiah came the first time, the Pharisees, chief priests, Scribes and rulers of the Israelites of old rejected Him. They rejected and crucified Him the first time.  The people of Israel also rejected Him and have largely remained desolate and in apostasy since them till now. Meanwhile the message of good news of the Kingdom of God went out through the Apostles and disciples of the Messiah to the world. The Gentile nations have accepted The Messiah. Today, as in other times, some few individual Jews have accepted Him, just like His few disciples of old. But in general, the apostasy of Israel as a nation will continue until just before His second coming. 
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Elijah will come as a messenger ahead of that second coming, (Malachi 4:6). Elijah and one other will arise to preach, (Revelation 11:3-4). The Antichrist will also severely persecute the Israelites. The combination of these will bring about the unparallel repentance and mourning by the Israelites as a nation, ahead of The Messiah’s return, (Zechariah 12:10-14)
                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        In the second time, He is not coming as a Lamb to take away sin. Rather, He is coming as a ruler and priest of God on earth. He will reign over the whole world from Jerusalem.

        In the Old Testament, the Syria region was known as Aram. During the time of Yeshua and John the Baptist, the Syria region was part of the Roman Empire. Syria region with capital in Antioch was a large Asia province of the Roman Empire. The Syria region was bounded in the north by Taurus and Amanus ranges, in the south by Palestine, in the east by the Euphrates and Arabia, and in the west by the Mediterranean. Judea, Galilee, Idumea and Samaria were part of Palestine in the Syria region.

He was later succeeded by Tiberius Caesar as the second Roman Emperor (from 14AD to 37AD).

        Yeshua predicted the times of the Gentiles (Luke 21:20-24). This is the periods of successive reign, power and occupations of Jerusalem and Judea region by the Gentiles. This continued till 1948AD, a total period of almost 1800 years!. The Romans destroyed Jerusalem in 70AD. They continued the destruction and desolation of Judea as they destroyed several villages and towns, killed most of the Jewish population, sold many into slavery and others fled between 132AD – 136AD. Many of the Judean Jews were sold into slavery, or transported as captives, or expelled from Judea and sent to various Roman provinces in the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

        After the Romans, the Arabs led by Caliph Umar, took control of Palestine and Jerusalem starting in April 637 AD, and ruled until the late 11th century. After the Arabs came the Crusaders. They ruled until around 1480AD.  Then the Turks in Ottoman Empire, ruled from 1486AD until  the First World War in 1917. The British took over Palestine and administered it from 1917 and ruled until 1948. And finally the State of Israel was created in 1948.

        John The Baptist had his own disciples. Andrew and one other disciple (called John) were originally among the disciples of John the Baptist. Both Andrew and this other disciple heard when John the Baptist made the remark about Yeshua being the Lamb of God (John 1:29, John 1:35-37). Both of them followed behind Yeshua to know more about Him.

He also wrote the book of Revelation, and the writer of the first, second  and third Epistles of John in the New Testament. He was not writing to report what was told to him by another, but from own person experience from the beginning of the ministry of Yeshua. Apostle John had direct personal experience, and was a witness of what happened during the ministry of The LORD Yeshua, from the early stage to the end.

        No other living being in heaven, on earth or under the earth that has the quality of Yeshua, the begotten Son of God Himself.  Even demons refer to Him as The Son of The Most High God, (Matthew 8:29, Mark 5:7, Luke 8:28). And God refers to Him as His beloved Son, in whom He is very pleased, (Matthew 3:17, Matthew 17:5, Mark 9:7, Luke 3:22).  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        He is of the same seed, the same kind, the same type as God. And though being God, Yeshua did not cling to equality with God when He came. Instead, he humbled himself as a slave would. To accomplish His assignment, He took on the weak human form, was completely obedient to God the Father, and died on a cross to save us. His Name, power and authority is above all others in heaven, on earth or under the earth. Accordingly, every knee bows to Him and every tongue confess He is LORD, to the glory of God The Father, (Philippians 2:6-11).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Death And Resurrection Awaited Since Adam’s fall: As concerning the redemption of all humans, the death and resurrection of the Lamb of God was what God and the angelic host had been looking forward to for centuries since the fall of Adam and Eve. While His death fully paid for the penalty of sin of the fall, His resurrection brings life. The death and the Resurrection of The LORD is therefore the most important thing that happened for all believers. Believers in the LORD would have been without hope and the most miserable if there was no resurrection in The LORD. He is the first fruit of the dead, (1 Corinthians 15:20). His resurrection confirmed there is hope for every believer after this life. For indeed, those that are asleep (physically dead) in Him will rise up again. Then those who are still alive will be caught up together with them in the air to join The LORD, and will be with Him forever, (1 Corinthians 15:20, 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, 1 Corinthians 15:51-52).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        The LORD Yeshua was raised from the dead before dawn on the day after Sabbath, the first day of the week, on Sunday, Yom Rishom. He was raised from the dead by God through the life giving  power of the Holy Spirit, (Romans 8:11).  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        Following His resurrection, there was a powerful earthquake, according to the account of Matthew, (Matthew 28:1-2). This happened when an angel of The LORD (ADONAI) descended from heaven. The angel did not come to resurrect The LORD, for He was already risen by the power of God through the life giving Holy Spirit. The angel did two things. First, he came and rolled back the sealed stone from the entrance to the tomb, where Yeshua was buried. He sat on the stone and waited. Neither did the angel did come to roll away the stone so that the risen LORD Yeshua could come out of the tomb. For The LORD, with His glorified body, could go through any physical barriers of walls, stones, etc. The second purpose of the angel, was for the people of The LORD, His disciples, His followers to see and know that the tomb was empty. Yeshua was no longer there. This was why the angel sat and waited. This was why there was more than one angel, who confirmed to them the resurrection, until The LORD showed Himself! 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        #1 The Women’s First Visit And The Empty Tomb: The women were the first to come to the tomb very early at dawn with burial spices, intending to anoint the body of The LORD in the tomb. They could not do so on the day He died, because it was the Passover preparation day. There was no time by the time Yeshua died and the body released for burial. They had to wait until the third day, the day after the Sabbath. The women who came included Mary Magdalene, also the other Mary (the mother of James and Joseph), Salome (the mother of Zebedee’s sons), and other women, (Matthew 28:1, Mark 16:1, Luke 8:1-3). When they arrived at the tomb, they saw the stone used to seal the tomb had been rolled and the tomb was empty. The angel informed and assured them that The LORD Yeshua was risen, (Matthew 28:1-7, Mark 16:1-6).  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        We do not know how many angels were there. On this great occasion, there may have been a huge company of them, we do not know. Angels can be visible or invisible depending on the purpose of being at a place and instructions they have received from God. Luke reports there were two angels, who spoke to the women about the empty tomb, (Luke 24:3-7). Matthew and Mark report of two, different angels.  Matthew reports of one sitting on the stone that had been rolled away, with appearance like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow, (Matthew 28:2-3). Then, Mark reports of another angel inside the tomb. He looked like a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side, (Mark 16:5-6). 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        #2 The Women Leave To Report To The Disciples: The women were perplexed, fearful and joyful at the same time, being told by the angels The LORD Yeshua was risen from the dead. But they went quickly, to go and tell the disciples of their discovery of an empty tomb, and what the angels told them, (Matthew 28:7-8, Mark 16:7-8, Luke 24:6-9, John 20:1-2). Mary Magdalene in particular, told Peter and the other beloved disciple (John). But their reports were not believed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        #3 Peter And John Go To Investigate: Peter and the other disciple, (John) ran as quickly as they could to the tomb to see for themselves, (Luke 24:12, John 20:3-10). The other disciple outran Peter. He stooped down, peered into the tomb and confirmed it to be empty. Peter arrived, and did the same. Then Peter went inside. The other disciple followed him inside as well. They saw the linen burial body wrapping cloths and the face cloth neatly folded there. The face cloth that had been wrapped on His head, had been folded together and lying in a separate place by itself. At this time, they saw the empty tomb, the burial clothes, but they did not see any angels or The LORD. Then they left and went away to their places, puzzled about what may have happened, (Luke 24:12, John 20:8-10). 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        #4 Mary Persists and Was First To The LORD: Mary Magdalene went in company of other women to the tomb for the anointing of the body. But they met an empty tomb. She went back into the city with the women to report the empty tomb to Peter and John. Then she came back again to the tomb side. Very likely, she did not come back alone, but in company of the other women, (Matthew 27:61, Mark 15:47, Luke 23:55-56, Matthew 28:1, Mark 16:1, John 20:1)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        But Mary Magdalene did not quit. She refused to leave the tomb, but wanted to know what had happened to the body of The LORD.  She remained standing and weeping by the tomb, (John 20:11). As she stooped down again to look into the tomb, she saw this time, two angels, in white guzzling garments. One was at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Yeshua had been laid, (John 20:12). While trying to find out from them about the body of The LORD, a third person showed up behind her. She did not know who the person was, but assumed He was the gardener. In fact, He was not the gardener, but the risen Yeshua Himself! (John 20:14-17). Thus Mary was the first among the followers to have seen The LORD. Mark also reported this fact, Mark 16:9-10). 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        By her actions, Mary Magdalene showed a lot of faith, devotion, determination, tenacity and courage. She left her comfort zone behind. She also ignored the risk posed by the Pharisees, Scribes, chief priests and other leaders of the Jews, who constantly persecuted Him, and finally got Him killed on the cross. And she refused to walk away after Peter and the other disciple did, until she had an answer. No wonder she was rewarded, with being the first to see The LORD after His resurrection. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        At this time, The LORD asked Mary Magdalene not to touch Him, because He had not yet ascended to the Father in heaven, (John 20: 17).We do not know if the other women were there or not at this particular time. However, Matthew reports that The LORD appeared to the women on their way into the city, (Matthew 28:8-10). This time, they did hold unto His feet in joy and worship. They went (again) and told the disciples, not of the empty tomb, but this time, about seeing The LORD. The disciples still refused to believe their story, (Mark 16:10-11).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        #5 Yeshua Appears To Two Disciples Going To Emmaus: Yeshua appeared to two disciples (His followers) that same day, after resurrection. This was as they had left Jerusalem and on their way to Emmanus, (Mark 16:12-13,  Luke 24:13-33).  They told some of the other disciples (followers), who did not believe them.  But they also went to tell the Apostles.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        #6 Yeshua Appeared To Peter: They other disciples, (followers) did not believe the two disciples from Emmaus when told they had seen The LORD Yeshua, (Mark 16:12-13). Then the two disciples from Emmaus went to tell the Apostles of the appearance of Yeshua to them. As they got there to tell their experience, the Apostles were there. The Apostles and others with them confirmed Yeshua was indeed risen and had also appeared to Peter, (Luke 24:34)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>

        #7 Yeshua First Appearance To The Apostles: The LORD appeared to the rest of the Apostles, while they were gathered that night in Jerusalem, (John 20:19-25, Luke 24:33-43). They were gathered with the doors lock, and suddenly, The LORD Yeshua showed up in their midst. This was in the evening of that first day, the Sunday of His resurrection. At this time, Thomas was not among them. He decided not to believe until after he sees and touches The LORD for himself. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        #8 Yeshua Second Appearance To The Apostles: After the first appearance to them, the Apostles left Jerusalem and went to Galilee where most of them lived. The angels that the women saw by the empty tomb had told them to tell the disciples to go to Galiee, where The LORD will meet them, (Matthew 28:5-7, Matthew 26:32, Mark 14:28) .

        We are warned to run away from sexual immorality. Sexual immorality is a sin against one’s own body. It is also a sin against God. God is holy and He wants us to be holy unto Him. God cannot inhabit anything unholy. We deprived God of His habitation, for our bodies are the temples of God and the Holy Spirit, (1 Corinthians 3:16-17, 1 Corinthians 6:17-20).

        It is also a sin against the natural order of things as created by God. It is an attempt to change or bring it to an end. In the beginning God created them male and female, (Genesis 1:27, Genesis 5:2, Matthew 19:4, Mark 10:6). He created them male and female to provide companionship for each other. And are also to be fruitful, multiply and replenish the earth with their own kind, (Genesis 1:28). God did not make them male and male, female and female, or human and animal. The man became one with the woman in relationships  and body.

        Any sexual relationships  apart from male-female goes against God’s purpose. It is naturally impossible for man-man, woman-woman, human-animal sexual relationships  to fulfill the command and purpose of God in His creation of the man and the woman.

        God also created them in His own image and likeness. His image and likeness are the attributes of God are manifested in fruit of His Spirit. This includes love, joy, peace, gentleness, goodness, godliness, meekness, perseverance and self-control, (Galatians 5:22-23). But because of sin, these attributes and likeness of God in mankind began to degrade over time. As they degrade, so did satisfaction, contentment, quality, and kind of fruit in the natural humans. Then humans began to look for other ways to fulfill that which was missing because of sin.

        It started with fornication, adultery and incest, (ref Leviticus 18:6-23).

Today we have same-gender sexual relationship, sodomy, homosexuality lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, lesbigay, bestiality, zoophilia and others. It never used to be at this scale. It is now like cancer spreading rapidly, it is rampart everywhere. The society refuses to acknowledge it is a problem. It has become a vogue. Anyone who dear speaks out Otherwise, immediately becomes an enemy, a target, and a victim of attacks.

        The complete separation of the created from the Creator has consequences. The mind and body have become disorderly, lacking peace within, like being sick and looking for remedy.
 Sickness came through sin. And sin is a spiritual problem. Yet the society is turning to medical to solve a spiritual problem. Sickness of the body or disorder of the mind is a product of sin and sinful nature which came in through Adam and Eve. It is what came to mankind when the Creator has been pushed out of the created. And it gets worse from generation to generation, unless the Creator is brought back into the life of the created. What used to be unacceptable and abominable because it directly goes against God, is now being promoted as acceptable in the society. The more the creator is pushed out, the more the power of sin increases and the more the societal vices, whether of drugs, sexual issues, etc. Whether drugs or sexual issues, they are human ways of trying to find a cure to a spiritual problem, the cure of peace for the mind and body.

        God is Spirit. Mankind is spiritual, with body, soul and spirit. Mankind was not created, designed, to live apart from God, because God created mankind to have a relationship with Him and live together. When God, the Creator and the spiritual part is absent from the body and soul, it brings about chaos, disorder, spiritual sickness in the life of an individual or society.

Yet humans created by God, have failed to acknowledge the existence of the Creator or a close relationship with Him. It is futile.

        The restoration of the original relationships  with God which brings peace, wholesomeness, to the body, mind and spirit comes through His begotten Son. We must go back to Him, to His workshop and be restored like new. And the workshop is through His Son, (John 3:16-18, 2 Corinthians 5:17). It starts with realizing and acknowledging our error. Then God accepts us back through His Son, His own equivalent of the manufacturer’s repair workshop that He has made available for mankind.

Wickedness is reaching an epic proportion. The epic proportion of wickedness is a manifestation of the epic level of sin. They go hand in hand.

        To be dead to sin is to be crucified with Yeshua The Messiah. It is for all parts, passions or desires for sin to be dead! (Galatians 2:20). For those who are in The Messiah have crucified the carnal flesh with its passion and desires for sins, (Galatians 5:24, Colossians 3:3). They have put to death what belongs to the sinful carnal earthly nature, including  sexual immorality, uncleanness, vile passions, evil desires or cravings, and greed or covetousness.

        Every true believer has been baptized into the death of Yeshua The Messiah, crucified with Him, (Romans 6:2-4). The believer no longer lives a life of their own, the old self, but of Yeshua The Messiah, (Galatians 2:20). For the old self, the sinful, carnal nature, has been crucified with Him on the cross. The sinful nature of the carnal body has been done away with. It has been rendered inoperative. And as a result, the believer is no more enslaved to sin, (Romans 6:6). The believer is totally immersed, submerged, buried deep into The Messiah Yeshua, and living in Him, (Colossians 3:3).

        Being dead to sin, is to live the new life of righteousness in God, with love towards God through The Messiah. To love Him is to obey His commandments, (John 14:15). Being dead to sin is therefore to be free from the desires of a life of disobedience. For disobedience leads to death and not life! For disobedience is sin and sin leads to dead! 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
Being dead to sin is not to allow any parts of oneself as instruments (weapons) of unrighteousness to serve sin. It is to give oneself completely to God, and to use every part of oneself as an instrument (weapon) of righteousness to God, (Romans 6:13).

        It is to no longer have the freedom to live a life of sin. It is to no longer be a slave to sin. It is to no longer allow sin to rule over one. Instead, it is to become a slave to righteousness. It is to live under grace, the merciful lovingkindness of God, that comes with righteous living that leads to life. It is to no longer be under the power of sin which leads to condemnation. For living in sin does not lead to life, but condemnation or eternal death!

        We have been cleansed from our former life of sin through the blood of Yeshua The Messiah. Through the grace of God, we have now become a new creature in Him (2 Corinthians 2:17). God is now able to live in us as His Temple. Through our fruit of righteous living, we show that we are children of God and He lives in us, (Matthew 7:16-20). Through The Holy Spirit in us, God empowers, energizes us to continue living a godly life that is pleasing to Him. We know what pleases Him through His Law which is now written in our hearts! God does not live in an environment of sin. And neither does The Holy Spirit!. Those who enjoy a lifestyle of sin, will blindly argue The LORD has done all, and the grace is there to cover them. They are those who want to live outside of The LORD, and expect grace to cover them. They are like a branch that wants to live and grow on its own. But a branch that is not in Him is cut off and withers. Then they are gathered and thrown into the fire to be burned, (John 15:6, Matthew 13:41-42, Matthew 13:49-50, Luke 3:17). For if a believer willfully continues to sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice left to cover the sins of such a person. The only expectation from such a person is the certainty of the terrible judgment, and fiery anger which will consume God’s enemies, of which such people has become, (Hebrews 10:16-27). For grace is no longer available.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        To be dead to sin, is to live within Him. One is either dead to sin by living within Him or dead in sin, living outside of Him. Where God does not abide, sin and death abound. Sin leads to death. A believer cannot continue to live in sin, and expect grace to abound. Such a person becomes an enemy of God. And what abounds from a continued life of sin is death!

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Satan, the god of this world has already been defeated and judged. Believers have power over Satan, but it does not include binding him. The time for Satan to be bound is not here yet and believers should not try to bind him. For now, Satan cannot be bound, and will not be bound, until the start of the millennium reign, (Revelation 20:1-3). During the millennium, he will be kept in hell, a spiritual prison, for one thousand years. And later on, he will be thrown into lake of fire, (Revelation 20:7-10). That is after his job of deception is completed.  Until then, Satan still has a job to do. The choice of good and evil, obedience and disobedience to God, both exist to the end. And every human being, from Adam to the end, must be presented with these alternatives and must make a choice between the two. Satan's job is to deceive by presenting the evil alternative alongside the good, for everyone to make a choice. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Until then, the power believers have over Satan is to resist, reject or rebuke him in the Name of The LORD and he will surely flee, (Matthew 4:9, James 4:7, Jude 1:9, Zechariah 3:2). And this power is powerfully effective and works. At a believer's command, Satan cannot hang around, if he is not wanted!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        Unlike Satan, however, the demonic spirits, his workers and agents can be bound, (Matthew 10:1, Mark 16:15-18, Luke 10:19-20). Believers have the power to bind them, using the authority of the Name of the Son of God, The Messiah Yeshua of Nazareth.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        To do this, a believer must himself be a genuine follower of The Messiah, obedient to God, and unlike the sons of Sceva, (James 4:7, Acts 19:13-17). Each person must totally choose which side he or she belongs. It cannot be one leg in one and another leg in another. It must be either hot or cold, and not lukewarm, in between the two kingdoms. Believers who choose to obey are enabled, empowered by the Holy Spirit to do so.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The spiritual world works by authority. Genuine followers of The Messiah have higher authority over  the kingdom of darkness. They derive their powers and authority directly from The LORD himself, (Philippians 2:9-10, Matthew 10:1, Mark 16:15-18, Luke 10:19-20, Matthew 16:19, Matthew 18:18). But the disobedient ones have little or no authority. The devil is their master. They are in fact under the authority of Satan and the demonic spirits. So, how can they control one who is higher than them. Water does not naturally flow uphill, but downhill. Hence the experience of the sons of Sceva.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        Satan is always going around, looking to swallow up, looking to incapacitate, looking to tempt believers to fall to his side or to accuse them, (1 Peter 5:8, Job 1:8-10, Job 2:1-5, Zechariah 3:1-5). But believers are protected by the righteousness given to them by God through The Son, (Isaiah 54:17, 1 Corinthians 1:30). Believers have at their disposal, the weapon of the Name of The LORD, the weapon of the Blood of The Lamb, (Revelation 12:10-11), the weapon of The Word of God, which is the Sword of the Spirit, (Ephesians 6:17), and the whole array of weapons of the Armor of God, which are both for defense and for attack against the principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this age, and against spiritual Hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places, (Ephesians 6:12-18).

        The time ahead of the return of The LORD will be characterized by lukewarmness and low faith in the things of God, (Luke 18:8, Revelation 3:15-17). It will also be characterized by the rise of many false prophets and christs, preaching heresies and performing miracles. It will be such that if it were possible, even the elect (chosen, approved) of God will be deceived, (Matthew 24:21-24). Added to this will be the unprecedented increase in anguish and tribulation. The result that some believers would willfully, voluntarily or consciously fall away. This falling away from the truth of God, by some of those who were once believers is what Apostle Paul calls the end time apostasy, apostasia, defection, departure, revolt, rebellion, or turning away,  (2 Thessalonians 2:3). It will come through temptation, deception or persecution, (Matthew 24:9-13, 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 1 Timothy 4:1-3).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </Text>

        The spirit of the anti-Messiah (anti-Christ) would be very strong in the world. Then there will be the actual revealing, the disclosure of that man of sin. He will be a human male, who has wandered away from the path of uprightness into lawlessness. Satan will use him to lead the rebellion against the law of God. He is described as the son of perdition, that is one heading for utter destruction of eternal misery in hell or lake of fire, (2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7:25, Revelation 19:20-21).

        The Holy Spirit has been restraining that spirit till now and will continue to do so, until the appointed time for his reign, (2 Thessalonians 2:6-7). The man of sin will oppose and also exalt himself haughtily above all that is spoken of God. He will do the same against every object (idols, carved images) that people worship. He will even sit in the Temple of God, claiming that he himself is God, (Daniel 9:27, Matthew 24:15, 2 Thessalonians 2:4, Revelation 13:3-8, Revelation 13:14-17).

        The revealing of the man of sin does not mean The Holy Spirit will leave the earth or leave the believers helpless on earth. It just means The Holy Spirit will stop restraining him and will allow him to rise to reign for his appointed time. The Holy Spirit will however continue to convict the world of sin. He will work to strengthen the believers during the great tribulation during the reign of the anti-Christ. He will prepare them for the ultimate day of arrival of The LORD, (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 14:14-16). The lukewarm Church and Israel will first be purified through the persecution they suffer from the ant-Christ or man of sin.

        The Scripture says that the time will be troublesome, perilous, or dangerous, (2 Timothy 3:1-4).  People will become very selfish, loving only themselves. They will also love money.

People will be unthankful, ungrateful for what they receive from God or others. They will indulge in unholy lifestyles. People will be hard-hearted, unloving to others. They will be unforgiving to those who do wrong to them. They will refuse to be reconciled when there is a conflict with others.  They will be slanderous with false accusation of others.

        It was the veil at the entranceway to the first section of the Tabernacle . The first section of the Tabernacle is called the Holy Place or Sanctuary (Tabernacle of Meeting).

        The second veil or screen was within the Tabernacle itself. The Tabernacle had two sections, the Holy Place and The Most Holy Place, that were separated by the second veil or Screen, (Exodus 26:31-35, Exodus 40:21).

        While The LORD was on the cross, He cried with a loud voice the second time and released His spirit. At that moment, some significant events took place. The Temple Veil was torn from top to bottom. There was also the earth quake and the rocks that were split, (Matthew 27:50-51, Mark 15:37-38, Luke 23:45, Ephesians 2:11-18, Hebrews 9:1-14, Hebrews 10:19-23).

        The Temple Veil separated the Tabernacle of Meeting, the Holy Place from the main Temple area. Only the Priests could enter into the Tabernacle of Meeting. But this Tabernacle of Meeting was where The LORD promised to meet with the people, (Exodus 29:42-43).

        The tearing of the Temple Veil from top to bottom signifies the removal of that partition. It fulfills this promise of God. It symbolically meant that not only the Levite priest could see or enter the Tabernacle of Meeting, but the people. It means we can fully enter into the priesthood service for our God through The Messiah. And indeed, every believer in The Messiah is a priest of God. For every believer is a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, to proclaim the praises of God who called every believer out of darkness into His marvelous light, (1 Peter 2:9). In the Tabernacle of Meeting are the Lampstands, The Table and consecrated showbread, (Hebrews 9:2). As we enter, we should freely feed on the bread of His Word, and our understanding being enlightened with the light from  the Lampstand of The Holy Spirit.

        There is still the second Veil or Screen separating the Tabernacle of Meeting from the Most Holy Place, the Inner Sanctuary.  The Scripture does not mention that this veil was torn. And only The High Priest could go beyond this screen, once a year, into the Most Holy Place. In terms of the earthly Temple, The Most Holy Place is the inner Sanctuary, where God lived. But the earthly Temple and Tabernacle are only a copy of the real, built with human hands. In the heavenly Sanctuary, it is where The Throne of God is. And The Messiah as our The High Priest, has entered into the heavenly Most Holy Place, mediating on our behalf before God,  (ref Hebrews 8:1-2, Hebrews 9:1-15). The earthly veil which was not reported torn has been replaced by His body. For His body is the veil in the heavenly Sanctuary. And He is also the High Priest in charge, (Hebrews 10:19-22). As believers, we are sprinkled clean by His blood with no guilt of sin. We enter into the inner Sanctuary through The Messiah. For every believer is in Him and a part of His body. Being in His body takes us right into the inner heavenly Sanctuary where the throne of God is. We must enter with a sincere heart, full of faith and washed with the water of His word, for we are made clean by His word, (John 15:3, Ephesians 5:26). The inner Sanctuary houses the Ark in which are kept the golden pot that has Manna, Aaron’s staff that budded, and the two Tablets of the commandments, (Hebrews 9:4).

        Those that ate the earthly manna died in the desert. But when we partake of the hidden heavenly Manna we never die again. For The Messiah is the Manna, the bread of life,(John 6:48-51, Revelation 2:17).

        Finally, God now lives directly within each believer. For the body of every believer is now a Temple for God and The Holy Spirit to dwell in, (1 Corinthians 3:16, 2 Corinthians 6:16). This has been made possible through the cleansing by the blood of The Messiah.

        The Nicolatians are a sect who were practicing the error, the evil counsel of Balaam. They put stumbling blocks before the Church of God to make them fall away from their faith. They engaged in ungodly, evil practices that defiled them before God. Idolatry and worship of idols were very common among the Gentile nations. They encouraged people to eat things sacrificed to idols. They also entice them in committing sexual immorality, (Revelation 2:6, Revelation 2:15, Numbers 31:16, Numbers 25:1-5). The Scripture clearly warns the holy people of The LORD to keep away from sexual immorality, or not to be associated with things offered to idols, or not to eat anything that still has blood in them. Even now, some believers still go eating the foods or meat offered as sacrifices by others to their gods.  The Apostles of The LORD had also warned against these, (Acts 15:20, Acts 15:29,  Acts 21:25, Genesis 9:4, Leviticus 17:11-12, Deuteronomy 7:25-26, Leviticus 18:6-23, Genesis 19:1-13, Romans 1:21-27, 1 Timothy 1:9-10, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, 1 Corinthians 6:17-20, Ephesians 5:5, Galatians 5:19-21, Jude 7, Revelation 22:14-15)

        There will be two witnesses or prophets of The LORD in the end time. They will be based in Jerusalem, wearing sackclothes and testifying about God and The LORD, (Revelation 11:3-4). They are described as the two olive trees and the two lampstands, standing in the presence of The LORD of the earth.  They will prophesy for a total of 1,260 days (42-months or three and half years). They will be very powerful, with the power to send fire through pronouncements from their mouths to destroy those they consider as enemies. They will be able to shut the sky not to produce rain, to turn water into blood and strike the earth with different kinds of plagues as they so want, (Revelation 11:3-4). The whole world will be so terrified of them, that the peoples will celebrate when they are killed at the end of their assignment, (Revelation 11:7-10).

        In the Old Testament time, Elijah had stopped rain for three and half years. And at the end of the drought, he called on fire from heaven to consume the offering he had prepared before The LORD, (1 Kings 17:1, 1 Kings 18:36-39, 2 Kings 1:10). He had also sent fire to destroy the soldiers sent by King Ahaziah to arrest him, (2 Kings 1:10-12).

        Moses also brought various plagues on Egypt, (Exodus 7:17-19, Exodus 7:14-11:10). And the earth opened and swallowed up Korah, Dathan and Abiram when they rebelled against Moses. Then the fire of God also consumed 250 other men who sided with them (Numbers 16:23-35). Both Elijah and Moses had also appeared with The LORD on the mount of transfiguration, (Matthew 17:1-9, Mark 9:2-10, Luke 9:28-36).

        There are two covenants, the old and the new covenants. In the end time, they will come together. They are both for the generation that started from after the flood. And it is the time of this generation that started after the flood that is coming to an end. It makes sense to have two witnesses, one representing the old covenant and the other representing the new covenant as a witness in the end time. Lets look at who those two prophets could be:
                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Prophet From The Old Testament or Covenant:
Moses: The Scriptures has not named Moses as coming back in the end time to preach. Also Moses had died (Deuteronomy 34:1-8). And there was even a contention for his body by Satan, until Michael the archangel rebuked Satan, (Jude 1:9). Moses is now in a glorious state of immortality in paradise. So for Moses to come and die a second time, would be farfetched, (Hebrews 9:27-28, Revelation 11:7). For these reasons, Moses is ruled out. 

                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Elijah: The Scriptures clearly mentioned Elijah as a prophet who would come back in end time, (Malachi 4:5-6). Also, Elijah did not die, but was taken away in a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11). He was at the transfiguration of he LORD, (ref Matthew 17:1-9, Mark 9:2-10, Luke 9:28-36). Elijah, would be a witness from the Old Testament times, that would testify of The LORD in the end time. 
                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Enoch: Many have speculated that the second prophet would have to be Enoch. He, like Elijah, did not die. He was taken away by God, (Genesis 5:21-25). However, Enoch was of the generation before the flood of Noah. He does not belong to this generation that started after the flood. He was not a witness of the Old Covenant from Abraham or from Moses or the Torah that was given to the Israelites. Enoch has nothing to do in the Old Covenant. Elijah already would represent the time of the Old Covenant. And neither does Enoch or Elijah have anything to do in the New Covenant. Enoch was also not at the transfiguration of The LORD. Apart from not knowing the genealogy of Elijah, Enoch and Elijah share similar ministry.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The New Testament Witness: Lets look at the disciples of The LORD who were witnesses of the New Testament. John along with Peter and James were three disciples who witnessed everything The Messiah The LORD did. These Apostles witnessed the entire New Testament Ministry of The LORD, from the very beginning, to the death on the cross, the resurrection and ascension to heaven, (Matthew 4:21-22, Mark 1:19-20, Matthew 10:2, Mark 3:17, Luke 6:14). They had the power to perform miracles. James was John’s brother, and were nicknamed sons of Thunder (or fire) by The LORD, (Mark 3:17). John and James had at one time threatened to call fire from heaven to consume the people of the village who opposed The LORD (Luke 9:54-55). These three, John, along

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Apostle John apart from being an eye witness of the LORD has been a key player in the New Covenant. He also wrote many of the books of the New Testament, ( John 1-21, 1 John1-5, 2 John 1, 3 John 1, Revelation 1-22). Elijah fought against the false prophets in the Old Testament. Like Elijah, John also had to fight against the false prophets and heresy in the early Church (1 John 2:18-23, 2 John 1:7-11). John was later banished to the Island of Patmos, where he received the prophesies in the Book of Revelation,(Revelation 1:9).  Before The LORD ascended to heaven, the news was going around among the disciples that John will not die till The LORD comes back, (John 21:21-23). Furthermore, in the Book of Revelation, John was instructed to eat the little book. He was also furthered informed by the angel that he would prophesy again before many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings, (Revelation 10:8-11). The word “Again”, means later or in addition to what he had or was already doing. There is no record that John had already done this. He was said to have lived in Ephesus after Patmos, where he wrote the gospel and the epistles. Some believe he had not died, but others say he died and was buried in Ephesus.

        But despite all these, does it really matter who the second prophet would be? Enoch or John? The answer is No! If the knowledge of this is important enough, The LORD would have said it. Therefore, we should not be consumed with much speculations. There is enough to keep every believer and faithful worker in the Kingdom to be busy. The focus of every believer should be to make their election sure (2 Peter 1:10-11). A lot will happen in the end time and the concern of the true believer should be about winning souls for The LORD and being mindful of the impending sudden appearance of The LORD! Amen!

Satan will heal and revive him back to life from his fatal wound. He will also give his power, throne, and great authority to the Man of Sin (Revelation 13:2-4).  And because of the full spirit of Satan in him, he would no longer have anything human in him. From that time on, he is more of The Beast, (2 Thessalonians 2:3-9, Revelation 14:1-8). At the end, he will not die the human death on earth, being no longer human. He will be sent straight to the lake of fire, (Revelation 19:20).

        One of the first actions after receiving the spirit and power of Satan would be to kill the two prophets who have reached the end of their assignment as a witness es of God in Jerusalem, (Revelation 11:3-7). They would have been prophesying for 1,260 days (42-months or three and half years). Their bodies will be seen from Jerusalem by peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations on earth, (Revelation 11:7-10). Today, in this generation, we are witnesses of the increasing power of technology, knowledge, satellite communications, social media, instant messaging, televisions, and radios all over the world. Manymore are being rapidly developed and launched. But twenty centuries or two thousand years ago when John received This prophecy, no one would have believed or understood, except of course those who have absolute faith in The LORD, of His power to make things happen.

        The world will marvel at his miraculous come back to life, and the great power he has received from Satan and also at his mighty victory over the two prophets. The Antichrist would also desecrate the Temple, and place in there his image (the abomination of desolation) to be worshipped as the god all over the world. So they will begin to worship him and Satan. Idolatry will become full blown all over the world like never before. He will intensify his blasphemy and pompous words against God, and exalt himself above all else. It is after the abomination of desolation that Israel or the Jews who had formed alliance with him will formally reject him. And for the second half of his seven years reign, he will go after and intensely persecute the Israelites and the Church (holy people, believers) of God, (Revelation 12:13-17). This will last for a period of 1,260 days (42-months or three and half years). Both woman (Israel) and her offspring (the Church or believers) would be intensely persecuted. For God gave salvation to the world through Yeshua born through the Jews (or Israel). And the Church came from this. And anyone who believes in Him becomes part of the His body or Church, like an offspring. All those who refuse to believe are not His own offspring, Jews and non-Jews alike! 

                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
But God will use this time of severe persecution to refine the believers, both Jews and non-Jews alike, (Zechariah 12:10-14, Zechariah 13:8-9, Daniel 9:27, Matthew 24:15, 2 Thessalonians 2:4, Revelation 13:4-8, Revelation 13:14-17). It is at the end of this that the rapture will take place. And many will be saved, (Revelation 7:9-12).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Mark of God:  God sets His seal or mark on those who are His, so that they would not be destroyed. The Israelites in Egypt were marked with the blood of the lamb on their doorposts in the Passover night, (Exodus 12:7-11). The Angel of death left them unharmed, while the firstborns of the Egyptians were destroyed. Similarly, Ezekiel observed when God instructed His Angel to go through the city of Jerusalem. To mark the foreheads of those who did not partake in the idolatry worship in which the Israelites and their leaders were engaged, (Ezekiel 9:3-6). 
                        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Everyone who belongs to God, who has been saved through His begotten Son, is covered with the blood and sealed with the Holy Spirit. God’s mark, is not a physical mark, visible to the human eye. The Holy Spirit is God’s seal, His mark, His identification, His guarantee on those who have been redeemed, (2 Corinthians 1:22, Ephesians 1:14, Ephesians 4:30, Galatians 4:4-6, 2 Corinthians 5:4-5, 1 Peter 1:2). He lives in them, (1 Corinthians 3:16, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20). A sin would grieve Him, but not make Him go away. He may depart however, when a person becomes apostate, living a continuous lifestyle of sin and disobedience to God.

        Having the seal of the Holy Spirit is not about speaking in tongues, prophesying or performing miracles. Satan and his followers can also do them, (Matthew 24:24, Revelation 13:2-15, Matthew 4:8-10 and Luke 4:5-8, Matthew 7:21-23). But everyone is known by the fruit they produce, (Matthew 7:16-20). Those who have the seal of The Holy Spirit, exhibit the Fruit of The Holy Spirit, (Galatians 5:22-23). The fruit of The Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering (patience), kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness (gentleness, or humility), and self-control. The fruit come as one package. And those who belong to The Messiah have crucified on the cross the sinful carnal passions and desires of the flesh, (Galatians 5:22-24, 2 Corinthians 5:17). They are inwardly transformed by the Holy Spirit and exhibit the life of Holiness like the Father in Heaven, (Genesis 17:1, Leviticus 9:1-2, Matthew 5:48).

        The Mark Of The Beast:  In the end time, The Anti-Christ also called Man of Sin or Beast will rule over every tribe, tongue, and nation on earth, (Revelation 13:7). He will mark his  followers, (Revelation 13:16). The Scripture identifies them in four ways: those who worship him and his image, those who have the mark of the beast, those who have the name of The Beast and those who have the number associated with his name, (Revelation 13:17, Revelation 14:9).

        The Antichrist system is a false system, to be led by a human being. The Antichrist will use a human identification number or system given as ‘666’ (Revelation 13:18). The number is imprinted the right hand or on the forehead of the bearer. 


                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
The Antichrist system, is an evil trilogy, with Satan as father, the Antichrist as his son, and The False Prophet as the evil spiritual deceiver, (Revelation 13:2-4, Revelation 13:11-16). In this regard, the first ‘6’, is for Satan. The second ‘6’ is for the Antichrist, and the third ‘6’, is for the False prophet. So, some will have ‘666’ marked or tattooed on their bodies.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        However, there is another representation of this mark for the Antichrist will ultimately take advantage of microchip implants technology. The ‘666’  represents the microchip implants with 6-bits in 3 places. So, each microchip will have 18 bits or digits, arranged in three groups, each of 6 bits. The numbers will be unique for each bearer, for easy identification and tracking.

        Serving God and remaining faithful to the end is a voluntary decision by each person. It will similarly be a voluntary decision by each person who takes the mark of the Beast. Some will be induced with rewards. And some will be persecuted or denied some comfort to the point they voluntarily succumb to take the mark. Only those who endure to the end will be saved, (Matthew 24:13). Believers on earth will be severely tested, similar to what King Nebuchadnezzar did. When he built an idol and forced everyone in his kingdom to worship, (Daniel 3:1-12). But Shadrach, Meshach and Abenego refused, preferring to die, even if God did not come to their rescue, (Daniel 3:13-18). The Antichrist will similarly have his own idol or image that people will be made to worship or die, (Revelation 13:14-15).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Apostle John was told by the Angel, that there are a total of eight kingdoms, (Revelation 17:9-11). The eighth and last one is kingdom of The Beast (AntiChrist), which will come. At the time the angel was talking to Apostle John, the Roman Empire was the kingdom ruling the world. It was the sixth. But before it, there were five other super kingdoms that had already reigned and fallen. The five were the Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Medo-Persia and Greek kingdoms. Then there would be the seventh superworld kingdom after the Roman Kingdom. And after the seventh kingdom, would come the Antichrist Kingdom, the eight. Since after the Roman Empire, many kingdoms have tried to rise. Without any doubt, there has been only one recognized economic and military superpower that has dominated the whole world. None other has been able to rule the world over the world affairs, combining economic, military and technology dominance. It is presently ruling the world, though gradually falling from its peak. It will eventually be replaced by the kingdom of the Antichrist.
                                </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        All the past world superpowers had great influence on Israel. The Egyptian kept the Israelites in slavery for 400years until freed by God through Moses, (Exodus 12:31). The Assyrians took all of the northern ten tribes of Israel into captivity, (2 Kings 17:4-24). The Babylonians took Judah and Benjamin into captivity (2 Kings 25:1-21). The Medo-Persia kingdom under Cyrus freed the Judeans from their captivity in Babylon, (2 Chronicles 36:22-23, Ezra 1:1-4). Under the Greek Empire, the Jews experienced abomination of desolation by the Greek king who took over the Temple and set up his idol in the Temple. He also killed many Jews and sent many into exile as prophesied by Daniel, (Daniel 11:29-35). The eventual defeat of this Little horn, the shadow antichrist, at the end of the Greece Empire, brought about the yearly Celebration of Hanukkah by the Jews since December 14, 164 BCE. The Romans crucified The Messiah (with the help of the Jewish leaders). The Romans later destroyed The Temple and Jerusalem in 70AD just as prophesied by Yeshua The Messiah, (Daniel 9:26, Matthew 24:1-2, Mark 13:1-2, Luke 19:41-44, Luke 21:5-6). Without doubt, the current seventh superworld kingdom will also leave a major mark on Israel before the Antichrist kingdom comes. The Antichrist Kingdom will first form an alliance with Israel and later take over the Temple (yet to be built) and persecute both the Jews and the followers (The Church) of The Messiah.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Angel gave Apostle John the identity of Babylon The Great Prostitute. The Angel told Apostle John that the prostitute woman, called Babylon, represents that Great City which is reigning over the kings of the earth, (Revelation 17:18). The Great City at the time of John was Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire. And its true origin goes back to the Babylon of old  and hence the nickname, Babylon (Zechariah 5:5-11, 1 Peter 5:13, Revelation 14:8, Revelation 16:19, Revelation 17:1-18).

        Today, Rome no longer rules the world with economic, military, or political power. However, it still continues to greatly influence and rule over kings and people of the world through the power of its religion. For it is described as prostitute full of immorality and idolatry. It has deceived and made the world drunk on its fornication, (Revelation 17:1-2). It is also accused of being drunk with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Yeshua, it has killed over the centuries, (Revelation 17:6).

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Neither it nor its representative leader will be the end time Beast or AntiChrist. The prostitute woman, Babylon will initially take advantage and be riding on the back or power of The Antichrist in the end time (Revelation 17:1-2). As a prostitute spanning many centuries, it has great influence over peoples, nations, kings and languages under its seductive religious power throughout the world. They will initially form an alliance. And indeed, The Beast will also enter into alliance with Israel,  other nations and institutions in the world, (Daniel 9:27). So the Antichrist coming to power in the end time and the prostitute woman, Babylon will seem to be in alliance for the mutual benefit of recognition, power and acceptance. But the relationships  will not last. For the Angel also told John, that the ten horns or kings ruling with the AntiChrist in the end time will hate it, (Revelation 17:16-17). They will make her desolate, stripe and expose her naked. They will eat the flesh, that is, take for themselves the riches or wealth of the woman or religion. Then they will completely burn whatever is left of it with fire to destroy. This is according to the purpose and plan of God. For before The LORD God it is a deceiver, a counterfeit with no love for God or for the true things or true people of God and Yeshua The Messiah, (Jesus Christ, Iēsous Christos). And its true origin is in Babylon of old!.
