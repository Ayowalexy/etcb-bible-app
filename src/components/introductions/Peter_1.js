        The Book of 1 Peter or Kefa Alef also known as The First Epistle or Iggeret of Peter is the twenty-first book of the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by Apostle Peter between 60AD â€“ 62AD.
                                                   </Text>
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               The First Epistle talks about persecution, which Peter himself had often faced, and believers do face. The LORD warned the Disciples and all believers ahead about this. It will continue till the end. Peter suffered many beatings, imprisonment, and threats as he preached the Word The Gospel of Good News.
                                                                                             </Text>
