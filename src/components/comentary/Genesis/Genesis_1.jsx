        There is the Beginning of God, the Beginning of Angels, and the Beginning of the creation of everything else. There is an eternity of time separating them.

        The Beginning Of The Universe:  The beginning spoken of in Genesis 1:1 is of the creation of the Universe, the heavenly bodies, the galaxies, the stars, the earth, the moon, and the things in them. This is the beginning also referred to in John 1:3 and Hebrew 1:2.  When the earth was first created, it was disorderly like a mass of dust and gas, before it became a solid. Then it was empty for a while, covered in darkness before The Holy Spirit began to move over the surface. This led to the creation of the things we see today on the earth. It is within this that human beings, animals (in the sky, on earth, and seas), and the plants were created.

        The Beginning Of The Angels: The Angels also have their own beginning. The Angels, who are all the creation of God, had been created and were existing before the foundation of the earth was laid. The Angels witnessed the creation of the earth. For the morning stars (Angels) sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy when the earth was created, (Job 38:7). If the earth is billions of years old, then The Angels are much older than that. Angels worship and serve God day and night, (though no nights in heaven). Angels are also ministering spirits sent out to minister, caring for the needs of those who will inherit salvation of God, (Psalm 104:4, John 3:5-8, Revelation 14:6-7).

         The Beginning Of Beginnings: Then there is the very beginning of beginnings, which goes back to Eternity. It is of God, Elohim, The Creator. No other existed before or bequeathed to God, but He created everything, (Job 41:11). He is the eternal God. He always was, He always is, and He always will be. He has been God from everlasting past and will continue to be to everlasting to come, (Psalm 90:2). At this beginning of beginnings, God The Father, God The Son, referred to as The Word, and God The Holy Spirit had always existed, (Psalm 90:2,  John 1:1-2, John 17:5 and Revelation 19:13). They are One. The Father is like the Architect or Designer of everything. The Son is like the Creator or Builder. The Holy Spirit is the Finisher, the Beautifier of what has been created. The Son shared the same glory with the Father from the beginning, (John 17:5). The Son is the Creator of everything else, (John 1:3, Colossians 1:16). It is through The Son that all things were created,  in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: All things were created by Him and for Him, ( John 1:3, 1 Corinthians 8:6, Colossians 1:16).

         It is impossible for a mere object such as a paper card or a paper airplane or a toy to try to know or fathom the origin of the person who made or designed it. The created object does not have such a capacity. And that is who we are! We are like the mere object and in fact, the Scripture describes us as mere empty breath, (Psalm 144:3-4, James 4:14). It would be impossible for us to understand or fathom the origin of our Creator. This is regardless of how smart we may think we are or what extraordinary abilities we may possess, which The Creator has kindly bestowed on us. A person who is really smart will know the smart thing to do is to stop wasting time on what is totally impossible or unfathomable. He has created us for His own pleasure, (Revelation 4:11, Ephesians 2:10, Ecclesiastes 12:13). The best course of action, when we have this understanding, is to focus on knowing the purpose for which each of us has been created. It is to focus on knowing and fulfilling that purpose for the pleasure of the Creator. It is to fear Him and obey His commandments. This is the conclusion of the wisest man who ever lived, (Ecclesiastes 12:13).

         A New Earth And Universe In The End: The earth as it currently is right now, is polluted with sin and evil of all kinds by human beings. The heavenly (expanse of the sky) is also polluted by Satan and his evil angels who will be expelled down to earth, (Revelation 12;7-9). Then they will stay in hell, and then finally be thrown in hellfire, (Revelation 20:3, Revelation 20:10). Due to these pollutions, there will be the creation of a new earth and a new heaven, expanse of the sky, (Revelation 21:1). However, this new heaven does not include the highest of the heavens where God is, in purity and holiness. This has never and can never be polluted and would not need to be recreated.
