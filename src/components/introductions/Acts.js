        The Book of The Acts or Gevurot of The Apostles also known as The Book of Acts or simply Acts is the fifth book of the New Testament.         </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Book of Acts is believed to have been written by Luke between 61AD and 64AD. The Book details the events from the Ascension of The LORD to heaven, the arrival of the Holy Spirit on the Day, the spread of the Gospel of Good News in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and to the rest of the Gentile world. It also details the persecutions faced by the Disciples.          </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Luke was a physician and not one of the Twelve Disciples or Apostles of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah (“Jesus Christ” in English, and “Iēsous Christos” in Greek/Latin). Luke abandoned his medical profession to accompany Apostle Paul in his missionary journeys.          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         It is uncertain if Luke was a Jew. If he was not, then he would be the only writer of huge volumes of Books in the Bible (Old and New Testaments) who was not a Jew or of the Shemite lineage. But considering his detailed or intimate knowledge of the Old Testament, (Hebrew Bible) and writings of the Gospel of Luke and of The Book of The Acts of The Apostles, it would not be surprising if Luke was in fact a Jew. In Colossians 4:10-11, Apostle Paul mentioned Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus, as the Jews (of the circumcision) who were his co-workers with him in preaching the Good News of The kingdom of God. Perhaps these strictly observe Judaism. Then in Colossians 4:14, Apostle Paul also separately mentioned Luke as our dear friend Luke, the doctor. Perhaps Paul was making a distinction of the work of Luke, which was different from preaching, and not as a Jew or Gentile.         </Text>
