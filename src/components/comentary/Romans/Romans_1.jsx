        <Text> [Commentary About Sexual Immorality And Unnatural Relationships]</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        God through the Scriptures has warned against all kinds of sexual immorality, including fornication, adultery, incest, male with male, female with female, human with animal sexual relationship, and all other kinds of unnatural sexual relationship          
         </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        We are warned to run away from sexual immorality. Sexual immorality is a sin against one’s own body. It is also a sin against God. God is holy and He wants us to be holy unto Him. God cannot inhabit anything unholy. We deprived God of His habitation, for our bodies are the temples of God and the Holy Spirit, (1 Corinthians 3:16-17, 1 Corinthians 6:17-20).         </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         It is also a sin against the natural order of things as created by God. It is an attempt to change or bring it to an end. In the beginning God created them male and female, (Genesis 1:27, Genesis 5:2, Matthew 19:4, Mark 10:6). He created them male and female to provide companionship for each other. And are also to be fruitful, multiply and replenish the earth with their own kind, (Genesis 1:28). God did not make them male and male, female and female, or human and animal. The man became one with the woman in relationships  and body.            </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Any sexual relationships  apart from male-female goes against God’s purpose. It is naturally impossible for man-man, woman-woman, human-animal sexual relationships  to fulfill the command and purpose of God in His creation of the man and the woman.

         God also created them in His own image and likeness. His image and likeness are the attributes of God are manifested in fruit of His Spirit. This includes love, joy, peace, gentleness, goodness, godliness, meekness, perseverance and self-control, (Galatians 5:22-23). But because of sin, these attributes and likeness of God in mankind began to degrade over time. As they degrade, so did satisfaction, contentment, quality, and kind of fruit in the natural humans. Then humans began to look for other ways to fulfill that which was missing because of sin.                              </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         It started with fornication, adultery and incest, (ref Leviticus 18:6-23). Over time, as sin continued to have its strong hold, sexual immorality has degenerated into even more perverse and abominable kinds, (Romans 1:24-27). Today we have same-gender sexual relationship, sodomy, homosexuality lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, lesbigay, bestiality, zoophilia and others. It never used to be at this scale. It is now like cancer spreading rapidly, it is rampart everywhere. The society refuses to acknowledge it is a problem. It has become a vogue. Anyone who dear speaks out Otherwise, immediately becomes an enemy, a target, and a victim of attacks.             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         The complete separation of the created from the Creator has consequences. The mind and body have become disorderly, lacking peace within, like being sick and looking for remedy.
 Sickness came through sin. And sin is a spiritual problem. Yet the society is turning to medical to solve a spiritual problem. Sickness of the body or disorder of the mind is a product of sin and sinful nature which came in through Adam and Eve. It is what came to mankind when the Creator has been pushed out of the created. And it gets worse from generation to generation, unless the Creator is brought back into the life of the created. What used to be unacceptable and abominable because it directly goes against God, is now being promoted as acceptable in the society. The more the creator is pushed out, the more the power of sin increases and the more the societal vices, whether of drugs, sexual issues, etc. Whether drugs or sexual issues, they are human ways of trying to find a cure to a spiritual problem, the cure of peace for the mind and body.

         God is Spirit. Mankind is spiritual, with body, soul and spirit. Mankind was not created, designed, to live apart from God, because God created mankind to have a relationship with Him and live together. When God, the Creator and the spiritual part is absent from the body and soul, it brings about chaos, disorder, spiritual sickness in the life of an individual or society.            </Text>

         We know where to take a car or an aircraft when they have issues. They are taken immediately, to the garage or workshop of the manufacturer who repairs them like new. Yet humans created by God, have failed to acknowledge the existence of the Creator or a close relationship with Him. It is futile.             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         The restoration of the original relationships  with God which brings peace, wholesomeness, to the body, mind and spirit comes through His begotten Son. We must go back to Him, to His workshop and be restored like new. And the workshop is through His Son, (John 3:16-18, 2 Corinthians 5:17). It starts with realizing and acknowledging our error. Then God accepts us back through His Son, His own equivalent of the manufacturer’s repair workshop that He has made available for mankind.                    </Text>

         But rebellions have consequences, and so it is with God. The present world has the past to learn from. In the days of Noah, the wickedness of mankind had reached epic proportion. They became engaged in unnatural Relationships    , producing what was not of their kind, (Genesis 6:1-8). So God proceeded to destroy the world through the flood.                                  </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         In the days of Lot, wickedness had also reached epic proportion. They also were in unnatural sexual relationship    . The Scripture says that men were in sexual relationships with each other, (Genesis 19:1-14). The end result was the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.              </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Today, sexual immorality such as same-gender sexual relationship, sodomy, homosexuality lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, lesbigay, bestiality, zoophilia and others, are not limited to just a city, state or country. It is now a global practice in every nation and parts of the world. The leaders and governments of nations have made laws to protect, promote, and institutionalize such abominable practices. Wickedness is reaching an epic proportion. The epic proportion of wickedness is a manifestation of the epic level of sin. They go hand in hand. It is a reflection of how far the society has turned away from God. Learning from the past, we know that God will not stay quiet forever. The whole world as it is now is ripe for what happened to people in Noah’s time and Lot’s time.            </Text>
