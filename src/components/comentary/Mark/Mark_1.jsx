        <Text>[Commentary About Elijah And John The Baptist Identical Ministry]</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Elijah and John the Baptist were different prophets for different times. But they had similar kind of assignment and operated with the power of the same Spirit. They have special ministry to do with the coming of the Messiah. There are two comings to the earth of The Messiah. Each of these two comings have a messenger to herald and prepare the way. This is the assignment of John The Baptist and Elijah.       </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        His first coming of The Messiah was as The Lamb of God. He was to come, suffer, be killed, and rise up from the dead on the third day, (John 1:29, John 1:36, John 3:16-17, Luke 24:44-47). He repeatedly told His disciples about this, ( Matthew 16:21, Mark 8:31, Luke 9:22, Matthew 17:22, Mark 9:30-31, Luke 9:44-45, Matthew 20:18-19, Mark 10:33-34, Luke 18:31-34).          </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The purpose of this first coming was to bring about repentance, forgiveness of sin and salvation to the world, (John 3:16-17, Luke 24:47).           </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Ahead of this first coming of the Messiah, a messenger was to be sent as prophesied in the Scriptures. The role of the messenger was to prepare the way, to warn the people. He was the herald, the announcer. He was to come ahead and prepare the people. (Isaiah 40:3, Malachi 3:1, Matthew 3:3, Mark 1:2-3, John 1:23).  John The Baptist was the messenger ahead of the first coming of The Messiah as Sacrificial  Lamb of God. He lived a secluded life in the wilderness. After many centuries of no prophets in Israel, He was born and then rose as the  lonely voice in the wilderness. He rose to announce through his preaching of the arrival of the Messiah, who will save the world from sin. He baptized, (totally immersed, dipped inside, submerged), the Messiah and revealed Him to the Israelites.             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         There is an interval between the first and second coming of The Messiah. After the first coming of the Messiah, and having accomplished the purpose of salvation for the world, He would go back to heaven and stay for a while. Then at the appointed time, He will come back again, the second time. This time would not be as the sacrificial Lamb of God, but as The King of God to reign on earth. He will reign and rule on earth as The King of kings and LORD of lords, (Revelation 19:11-21). He will both King and Priest of God on earth (Zechariah 6:12-13). The day He appears would be The Day of The LORD on earth. For He comes to put an end to sin, and would eliminate the rebellious, the disobedient, (Zechariah 14:1-4). It will be a day of doom for the antichrist, his false prophet and millions of their soldiers on earth, (Revelation 19:19-21).  It will also be a day of doom for Satan and his angels who will chained into hell, (Revelation 20:1-3). Refer to the commentary at the end of Zechariah 14 About The Day Of The LORD in End Time.          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Like the first coming, His second coming will be specially heralded by messengers. This time, there will be two messengers. One of them would be Prophet Elijah, (Malachi 4:6, Revelation 11:3-4, Zechariah 4:11-14, Matthew 11:10-15, Matthew 17:10-11). Elijah was around during the time of Ahab and Jezebel, (1 Kings 17:1-24, 1 Kings 18:1-40). He had defeated the false prophets led by Jezebel and brought revival to Israel. Prophet Elijah did not die, but was parted from Elisha his servant and then taken away in a chariot, (2 Kings 2:11-12). He was taken away but will come back to play a major role as a messenger ahead of the second coming of the Messiah in the end time. Elijah and Moses appeared and discussed with The LORD Yeshua during the transfiguration, (ref Matthew 17:1-9, Mark 9:2-10, Luke 9:28-36). Apart from Elijah, the other prophet who did not die as reported in the Scriptures was Enoch, (Genesis 5:24). He was of the first world or generation, which started with Adam and was destroyed in the flood in Noah’s time. Whether it is Enoch or Moses or one of the Apostles of the LORD or someone else who joins Elijah would be as determined by the LORD, who knows what is best in He plans.          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         The purpose of Elijah and of the other messenger in the end time would be like that of John the Baptist. His purpose is to prepare the Israelites, who had rejected Him when He first came. His purpose is to help them avoid the fierce anger and judgment of God, through getting them to repent and accept The Messiah.           </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         When The Messiah came the first time, the Pharisees, chief priests, Scribes and rulers of the Israelites of old rejected Him. They rejected and crucified Him the first time.  The people of Israel also rejected Him and have largely remained desolate and in apostasy since them till now. Meanwhile the message of good news of the Kingdom of God went out through the Apostles and disciples of the Messiah to the world. The Gentile nations have accepted The Messiah. Today, as in other times, some few individual Jews have accepted Him, just like His few disciples of old. But in general, the apostasy of Israel as a nation will continue until just before His second coming.           </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Elijah will come as a messenger ahead of that second coming, (Malachi 4:6). Elijah and one other will arise to preach, (Revelation 11:3-4). The Antichrist will also severely persecute the Israelites. The combination of these will bring about the unparallel repentance and mourning by the Israelites as a nation, ahead of The Messiah’s return, (Zechariah 12:10-14)          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         In the second time, He is not coming as a Lamb to take away sin. Rather, He is coming as a ruler and priest of God on earth. He will reign over the whole world from Jerusalem.          </Text>
