        <Text>[Commentary About The Two Veils –The Temple Veil And Tabernacle Veil]</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        In the old Temple, there were two veils or screens. The first one was the outer veil or screen called the Temple Veil.
                  </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        It was the veil at the entranceway to the first section of the Tabernacle . The first section of the Tabernacle is called the Holy Place or Sanctuary (Tabernacle of Meeting). The Temple Veil separated the Tabernacle from the main Temple area where the Altar of burn offering was, (Exodus 26:36, Exodus 40:28-30). 
                          </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The second veil or screen was within the Tabernacle itself. The Tabernacle had two sections, the Holy Place and The Most Holy Place, that were separated by the second veil or Screen, (Exodus 26:31-35, Exodus 40:21).
                          </Text>

        While The LORD was on the cross, He cried with a loud voice the second time and released His spirit. At that moment, some significant events took place. The Temple Veil was torn from top to bottom. There was also the earth quake and the rocks that were split, (Matthew 27:50-51, Mark 15:37-38, Luke 23:45, Ephesians 2:11-18, Hebrews 9:1-14, Hebrews 10:19-23).

         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         The Temple Veil separated the Tabernacle of Meeting, the Holy Place from the main Temple area. Only the Priests could enter into the Tabernacle of Meeting. But this Tabernacle of Meeting was where The LORD promised to meet with the people, (Exodus 29:42-43).
                             </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         The tearing of the Temple Veil from top to bottom signifies the removal of that partition. It fulfills this promise of God. It symbolically meant that not only the Levite priest could see or enter the Tabernacle of Meeting, but the people. It means we can fully enter into the priesthood service for our God through The Messiah. And indeed, every believer in The Messiah is a priest of God. For every believer is a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, to proclaim the praises of God who called every believer out of darkness into His marvelous light, (1 Peter 2:9). In the Tabernacle of Meeting are the Lampstands, The Table and consecrated showbread, (Hebrews 9:2). As we enter, we should freely feed on the bread of His Word, and our understanding being enlightened with the light from  the Lampstand of The Holy Spirit.

         There is still the second Veil or Screen separating the Tabernacle of Meeting from the Most Holy Place, the Inner Sanctuary.  The Scripture does not mention that this veil was torn. And only The High Priest could go beyond this screen, once a year, into the Most Holy Place. In terms of the earthly Temple, The Most Holy Place is the inner Sanctuary, where God lived. But the earthly Temple and Tabernacle are only a copy of the real, built with human hands. In the heavenly Sanctuary, it is where The Throne of God is. And The Messiah as our The High Priest, has entered into the heavenly Most Holy Place, mediating on our behalf before God,  (ref Hebrews 8:1-2, Hebrews 9:1-15). The earthly veil which was not reported torn has been replaced by His body. For His body is the veil in the heavenly Sanctuary. And He is also the High Priest in charge, (Hebrews 10:19-22). As believers, we are sprinkled clean by His blood with no guilt of sin. We enter into the inner Sanctuary through The Messiah. For every believer is in Him and a part of His body. Being in His body takes us right into the inner heavenly Sanctuary where the throne of God is. We must enter with a sincere heart, full of faith and washed with the water of His word, for we are made clean by His word, (John 15:3, Ephesians 5:26). The inner Sanctuary houses the Ark in which are kept the golden pot that has Manna, Aaron’s staff that budded, and the two Tablets of the commandments, (Hebrews 9:4).

         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Those that ate the earthly manna died in the desert. But when we partake of the hidden heavenly Manna we never die again. For The Messiah is the Manna, the bread of life,(John 6:48-51, Revelation 2:17). 
                                       </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         The staff of the High Priest is symbol of authority and The Messiah has given us access to His authority, (Matthew 28:18-20, Revelation 2:26-29). 
                                                </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         The Ark of Testimony or Covenant contains God’s Law. His law is now written in the tablets of our new hearts, (Jeremiah 3:16, Deuteronomy 30:6, Jeremiah 24:7, Jeremiah 31:31-34,  Jeremiah 32:39, Ezekiel 11:19, Ezekiel 18:31, Ezekiel 36:26-27, Hebrews 10:16, 2 Corinthians 5:17).
                                                </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         But The tablets were placed in front of the Staff and the Manna. This means, our obedience to God’s commands must be in place, be complete, before we can reach and have full access to the authority and eternal life.
                                                         </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Finally, God now lives directly within each believer. For the body of every believer is now a Temple for God and The Holy Spirit to dwell in, (1 Corinthians 3:16, 2 Corinthians 6:16). This has been made possible through the cleansing by the blood of The Messiah.
