        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Book of Revelation or  Hisgalus also known as Book of Revelations, or simply Revelation, is the twenty-seventh and last book of the New Testament. The name Revelation comes from the Greek word: apokalypsis, which means "unveiling" or "revelation" It is believed to have been written by Apostle John around  95AD.

               John was one of the two sons of Zebedee who were of the Twelve Disciples or Apostles of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah (“Jesus Christ” in English, and “Iēsous Christos” in Greek/Latin).  His brother was James.

               John was formerly a disciple of John the Baptist and then became a disciple of Yeshua The Messiah after His baptism. John was a beloved disciple, whom The LORD loved.  John along with Peter and James were particularly very close to The LORD. And the LORD took them to where other Disciples did not go. This includes the Mount of Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1, Mark 9:2, Luke 9:28), and raising of Jairus daughter from the dead, (Luke 8:51-54).

               John was the last surviving of the Apostles. The others had either died or were martyred. He was sent on exile by the Roman Emperor Domitian to the Greek island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea. This was after bathing Apostle John in hot oil, and he did not die. While John was in Patmos, he received and wrote The Book of Revelation.  Apostle John was also the writer of the Book of The Gospel of John, The Epistles of 1 John, 2 John and 3 John. He was said to have lived in Ephesus after Patmos, where he wrote the gospel and the epistles.

               Revelation is mostly about the end time. It is for believers to know and be prepared for what would happen in the end time. It is for all believers to be ready and alert for the coming of The LORD.

               As with the generation of mankind on earth before the flood, this present generation is rapidly heading to its own end because of sin. All over the world, they are increasingly rejecting God, The Creator, and instead embracing evil. They are sinking deeper into all manners of sins and wickedness. As we learnt from the Book of Genesis, the generation of Noah ended with the flood.  For this generation, the Scriptures from the Old Testament to the New Testament make us understand the ending would not be the same. The ending of this generation and the events leading to it are detailed in the Book of Revelation. 
                                                                    </Text>               
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               Those who read or hear the Prophecies in the Book of Revelation and do what it says would be blessed. The messages are from The LORD Himself. Therefore, everyone is warned to leave the Prophecies intact as they have been written, without removing any parts of the Prophetic messages contained it, and also not to add to any part of the Prophetic messages contained in The Book of Revelation. This is to retain the truth in it, and avoid heresies and deceptions by people. 
                                                                    </Text>

               The world is heading towards the reign of the Anti-Messiah or Antichrist who will complete the work of Satan for this generation. Many will follow him and would be destroyed when The LORD suddenly returns. Then there will be the Millennium reign, which will be followed with the second rebellion of Satan for that generation, (Revelation 20:7-10). At the very end, there will be the final judgment of the unrighteous. The present earth and heaven, (the expanse of sky above) as we know it, will also pass away, (Revelation 20:11). Then there will be a new heaven and a new earth, (Revelation 21:1). It will be a new beginning, in righteousness, with God living among mankind! , (Revelation 21:22-24)
