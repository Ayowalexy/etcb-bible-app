        The Book of James or Yaakov also known as The Epistle or Iggeret of James or Yaakov is the twentieth book of the New Testament. It was written between 48AD and  49AD.  It is believed to have been written by James, who was the blood half-brother of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah. He became a believer at the death and resurrection of Yeshua, who also appeared to him. Then he joined the other Disciples and Apostles, and became one of the pillars of the Church, especially among the Hebrew believers.

               James was martyred for his faith in 62AD.

               James addressed this epistle to the believers among the twelve tribes of Israel, the Hebrew believers. He encouraged them to continue to grow in their faith under severe trials they were facing. He also encouraged them to combine it with their good works of righteousness. He told them that to have faith and not put it to work through love is dead. Faith and love showed through good woks go with each other. Those who have faith in The LORD will ultimately demonstrate it through good works. He encouraged them to continue to help each other, and to avoid all forms of discrimination especially between the rich and the poor believers because all believers are one and the same before The LORD.

               The Epistle contains a lot of godly wisdom for believers. As such, it is often referred to as the Book of Proverbs in the New Testament.
