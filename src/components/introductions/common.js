        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Matthew or Mattityahu means “Gift of Yehovah or Jehovah”. The Book of The Gospel According to Matthew or Mattityahu, also known as The Gospel of Matthew  is the first book of the New Testament. 
                                    </Text>
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               The surname of Matthew was Levi. He was one of the Twelve Disciples and Apostles of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah (“Jesus Christ” in English, and “Iēsous Christos” in Greek/Latin). Matthew was a tax collector before The LORD called him to be one of His disciples. Tax collectors were also known as publicans (public revenue and tax collectors who were notorious for their greed and harshness). In calling Matthew, The LORD showed He came to save sinners, those who are lost. The Gospel of Good News of The Kingdom of God is for everyone regardless of their past or background. It brings hope for any sinner who will repent. Matthew left to join Yeshua The Messiah as His Disciple, and became one of His Apostles, who preached the Gospel of Good News.

               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               It is believed that Apostle Matthew wrote The Book or Gospel of Matthew. Some place the date between 70AD – 90AD, but may have been written well before the destruction of Jerusalem in 70AD. 
                                                                    </Text>

               Apostle Matthew gave a firsthand account as someone who was a direct witness, with personal knowledge of The LORD.
                                                                    </Text>

               He started from The Old Testament to show the genealogy of Yeshua as The Messiah, the prophecies about Him in the Old Testament that were all fulfilled, His birth, The message of salvation and Good News of The Kingdom of God He preached all over to the people, The miracles, healings and deliverances He performed among the people, as well as all His death and resurrection.

        The Book of The Acts or Gevurot of The Apostles also known as The Book of Acts or simply Acts is the fifth book of the New Testament.         </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Book of Acts is believed to have been written by Luke between 61AD and 64AD. The Book details the events from the Ascension of The LORD to heaven, the arrival of the Holy Spirit on the Day, the spread of the Gospel of Good News in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and to the rest of the Gentile world. It also details the persecutions faced by the Disciples.          </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Luke was a physician and not one of the Twelve Disciples or Apostles of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah (“Jesus Christ” in English, and “Iēsous Christos” in Greek/Latin). Luke abandoned his medical profession to accompany Apostle Paul in his missionary journeys.          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         It is uncertain if Luke was a Jew. If he was not, then he would be the only writer of huge volumes of Books in the Bible (Old and New Testaments) who was not a Jew or of the Shemite lineage. But considering his detailed or intimate knowledge of the Old Testament, (Hebrew Bible) and writings of the Gospel of Luke and of The Book of The Acts of The Apostles, it would not be surprising if Luke was in fact a Jew. In Colossians 4:10-11, Apostle Paul mentioned Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus, as the Jews (of the circumcision) who were his co-workers with him in preaching the Good News of The kingdom of God. Perhaps these strictly observe Judaism. Then in Colossians 4:14, Apostle Paul also separately mentioned Luke as our dear friend Luke, the doctor. Perhaps Paul was making a distinction of the work of Luke, which was different from preaching, and not as a Jew or Gentile.         </Text>

               Apostle Paul had not before been to the Colossian church. But he wanted to reach them, introduce himself and encourage them in The LORD.

               Paul wrote this to the believers in Ephesus, while he was in prison in Rome. The Emphasis is that Salvation is by grace through faith in Yeshua The Messiah.

        The Book of Hebrews or Yehudim also known as The Epistle or Iggeret to Hebrews or Yehudim is the nineteenth book of the New Testament. It was written around 66AD.

               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               Though the name of the written was not stated, but it can be concluded to be by Apostle Paul. This is inferred from the language and manner of discussions, similar to his other letters. Also he showed a very deep knowledge of Judaism and Torah and he mentioned Timothy, (who Paul refers to as his son by faith and worked with Paul).  
                                                                              </Text>

               The Hebrew believers were under intense persecution. For this reason, many of them were thinking of giving up their faith in The LORD and returning to their practices under the Law or Torah. The Epistle explains very clearly to them why it would be a step backwards, and why they need to continue in their faith in Yeshua The Messiah, The High Priest and Mediator for all believers.

               James addressed this epistle to the believers among the twelve tribes of Israel, the Hebrew believers. He encouraged them to continue to grow in their faith under severe trials they were facing. He also encouraged them to combine it with their good works of righteousness. He told them that to have faith and not put it to work through love is dead. Faith and love showed through good woks go with each other. Those who have faith in The LORD will ultimately demonstrate it through good works. He encouraged them to continue to help each other, and to avoid all forms of discrimination especially between the rich and the poor believers because all believers are one and the same before The LORD.

               John was formerly a disciple of John the Baptist and then became a disciple of Yeshua The Messiah after His baptism. John was a beloved disciple, whom The LORD loved.  John along with Peter and James were particularly very close to The LORD. And the LORD took them to where other Disciples did not go.

               In this Epistle John starts by confirming his own personal eye witness from his time with the Messiah. He goes on to talk about living in the light of God and showing His love to others. He reminds us of being sinners to whom God extends forgiveness when we confess and repent. The Epistle identifies those who are of God and reminds believers about the new commandment of The LORD, to love one another. Those who love God cannot love the things of the world that lead to sin. Apostle John also talks about deception in the end time and the need to test every spirit, with the standard of love and word of God.

He intrdouced himself as a brother of James. Both of them became believers and followers of The LORD after His death and resurrection.

        The Book of The Gospel According to Luke or Locke, also known as The Gospel of Luke is the third book of the New Testament. It is the longest of all the Books in the New Testament. It gives very detailed account of the genealogy, birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah (“Jesus Christ” in English, and “Iēsous Christos” in Greek/Latin).        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Luke wrote the Book of the Gospel of Luke and also of Acts of The Apostles.  Luke was a physician and not one of the Twelve Disciples or Apostles of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah.         </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        Luke abandoned his medical profession to accompany Apostle Paul in his missionary journeys. Luke spent time to interview a wide range of people, including The Apostles and Disciples who had firsthand eye witness about what The LORD did and of His death and resurrection. It was from that he wrote the Book of the Gospel of Luke, as a detailed account for Theophilus, a very noble person.          </Text>
         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>

         <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         It is uncertain if Luke was a Jew. If he was not, then he would be the only writer of huge volumes of Books in the Bible (Old and New Testaments) who was not a Jew or of the Shemite lineage. But considering his detailed or intimate knowledge of the Old Testament, (Hebrew Bible) and writings of the Gospel of Luke and of The Book of The Acts of The Apostles, it would not be surprising if Luke was in fact a Jew. In Colossians 4:10-11, Apostle Paul mentioned Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus, as the Jews (of the circumcision) who were his co-workers with him in preaching the Good News of The kingdom of God. Perhaps these strictly observe Judaism. Then in Colossians 4:14, Apostle Paul also separately mentioned Luke as our dear friend Luke, the doctor. Perhaps Paul was making a distinction of the work of Luke, which was different from preaching, and not as a Jew or Gentile.         </Text>

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        John Mark was a cousin of Barnabas, a fellow missionary traveler of Apostle Paul. Like Timothy, John Mark’s mother was a strong believer and follower of The LORD Yeshua The Messiah (“Jesus Christ” in English, and “Iēsous Christos” in Greek/Latin). It is most likely that John Mark himself became believer and a follower  of The LORD from his youth. As a follower, he may have witnessed His death and resurrection in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Mary. The Disciples and Apostles were meeting in their house in Jerusalem during the time of severe persecution. This was when Herod killed Apostle James and had kept Apostle Peter in prison, planning to kill him. It was their house where Peter went to meet the other Disciples after being freed from the prison by an angel, (Acts 12:12). And a servant girl, Rhoda was too excited to remember to open the gate for Peter. With these, John Mark had a personal experience and also had close contacts with the Apostles. It was from these experiences that John Mark gathered the information and wrote them down in the Gospel of Mark.          </Text>

        John Mark had also joined Apostle Paul and Barnabas to travel with them in their missions to preach the Gospel of Good News to the Jews and Gentiles. He went with Barnabas after Barnabas and Paul had separated, but later Mark and Paul came back together. He also traveled with Peter to Rome and served as his interpreter. It is also believed that Mark eventually became the Bishop of Alexandria.          </Text>

               Initially, Joshua made presumptions without actually going to consult with God. The Israelites paid the price. This included their defeat by the little Ai, and of the Gibeonites who successfully deceived them to enter into an agreement with them. Joshua learnt his lessons and repented. With God being with Joshua, the Jordan River parted; the wall of Jericho fall down after the Israelites matched round it once each day for seven days, as commanded by God; the Sun and the Moon stood in their place without in heaven and delayed going down for a whole day until Joshua finished completed his victory that day; God sent huge hailstones from heaven to crush the enemies on behalf of Joshua and the Israelites. These are just a few of God’s help when the Israelites obeyed Him.

The Book of  1 Samuel contains details of the anointing of Saul in Mizpah as first King and of the period of his reign over Israel. But due to the continued disobedience of Saul to the instructions of God, Samuel was directed  by God to go and anoint David to be the next King over Israel. David killed Goliath who was a terror to the Israelites and woman sang in praise of him. This made Saul all the more jealous of David. It was to take many years before the death of Saul and the formal ascension of David to the throne. At this time Samuel was already dead. Before David became king, he had suffered many persecutions, attempts by Saul to kill him. David was constantly on the run and in hiding. At times, he took temporary refuge even among the Philistines, and one time pretended to be insane to avoid being killed by them. During this time, he learnt obedience to God and to depend totally on Him. He also wrote many Psalms and songs in praise of God.

He had 700 wives and 300 concubines, many of that were foreigners. And towards the end of his reign, they turned his heart away from The LORD. Solomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and followed Milcom (Molech, Malcam) the abominable idol of the Ammonites. At the end of his reign, God took ten of the tribes away from under the rule of Judah. Ephraim began to rule over the northern ten tribes, starting with Jeroboam, who was formerly a servant of King Solomon. One of his first major acts was to build two golden calves. He placed one of the idols in Bethel and the second in Dan. After that the northern ten tribes began to worship them and gradually stopped going to Jerusalem to worship God in The Temple built by Solomon. Jeroboam led  Israel to worship them.

        Prophet Samuel had died before the end of the events of the Book of 1 Samuel. However, the Book of 2 Samuel or Shmuel Bais is also named in honor of him.  The Book of 1 Samuel and Book of 2 Samuel were originally one volume or Book together. But during initial translation of the Book, the period of reign of Saul was separated from that of King David. This was how it became two Books.  It is not exactly known who wrote the Book of 2 Samuel or Shmuel Bais. However, it is believed that either Prophet Nathan or Prophet Gad did. The Book of 2 Samuel is about the reign of King David over Israel, which was from 1010BC to 970BC. 
                                                                           </Text>

               David had waited a long time before he became King. David was thirty years old when he began to reign as King. He reigned for forty years in total. In Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months. And in Jerusalem he reigned over all of Israel and Judah for thirty-three years. As King, David showed kindness to the family of his friend Jonathan, who was the son of Saul.
                                                                                                                                          </Text>

               God continued to make David great. He conquered Jerusalem and all of the remaining of the land of Canaan. He extended the power of his kingdom over other nations and kings. They became his subjects and brought imposed revenue or taxes to David. This included the Philistines, Moabites, Zobahites, Syrians, Ammonites, Amalekites, Edomites, and others.

               King David brought the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem on second attempt. As the Ark was being brought the second time, David danced with all his strength before The LORD. Also, when those bearing the Ark of The LORD had gone six paces (steps), David would sacrifice oxen and fattened sheep.  But Michal, the daughter of Saul, who was David’s first wife ridiculed him. For this, The LORD shut her womb and never had any children. David had many wives. But despite this, he went on to commit adultery with Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, who was married to Uriah the Hittite. David initially tried to cover it up, and after that failed, he went on to set up Uriah to be killed in war front. The LORD was very displeased with David. The child born from the affair did not live, but died. However, God forgave David because he had repented. And Basheba went on to give birth to Solomon who succeeded David as King over Israel. In another major mistake of David, Satan incited him to conduct census of the able fighting men in Israel. God was displeased about it. As punishment, God gave David three choices. Based on David’s preferred choice of three days plague, Israel suffered from the plague by the angel of the LORD. King David wanted to build the Temple for The LORD, but The LORD would not allow him. He reserved it for Solomon to do so.  But The LORD made a Covenant with David, that his throne will be forever. The LORD Yeshua The Messiah is of the line of King David and will reign forever, when He returns. David prepared the design and most of the materials ahead for Solomon for building the Temple. 
                                                                                                                                                         </Text>

               Towards the end of his reign, David faced soe major challenges, from his family for successor. Absalom successfully planned treason and got all of Israel behind him as King. David had to flee out of Jerusalem for a while. Absalom slept in the open with the wives and concubines that David had left behind in the palace. Then Absalom went after David in battle to try and kill him. But in the end, Absalom was killed. David returned back to Jerusalem.

He had 700 wives and 300 concubines, many of that were foreigners. And towards the end of his reign, they turned his heart away from The LORD. Solomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and followed Milcom (Molech, Malcam) the abominable idol of the Ammonites. At the end of his reign, God took ten of the tribes away from under the rule of Judah.

               Ezra the son of Seraiah,  was a Levite and Scribe, with deep knowledge of The Torah. During the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra secured the permission and exceptional favor of the King to lead some of the exiles back to Jerusalem. Ezra was a man of faith, who depended on God to lead and protect the group as they journeyed from Babylon to Jerusalem. For this reason, he did not go to the King to seek for the deployment of the military to guard them along the way, against potential attacks and bandits.

               At this time, most of the Jews who had already returned, were backsliding from the ways of God as commanded in the Torah or Law of Moses. The Jews, including many Levites and priests were inter-marrying with pagans. This was in disobedience to God and it was also corrupting the Jews. Obedience to the Torah was particularly stressed since the Jews had been taken into exile for seventy years due to their disobedience.  Ezra, along with Nehemiah and other leaders, therefore led the revival effort among the Jews. They enforced practice of the Torah or The Law among the exiles that had returned. Ezra also read in assemblies of the people and taught them about the Torah, which most of them did not know about.

               While in Jerusalem, he led the rebuilding of the walls. This was despite stiff oppositions from the enemies of the Jews including Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab. He along with Ezra and others carried out revival among the Jews in the way of God with Torah or Law of Moses. He was in Jerusalem for twelve years before returning back to the King in Susa. However, he revisited Judah and found that the Jews were backsliding in some of the commands of The Law. They were also marrying non-Jewish wives. Nehemiah made efforts to correct things in the way of The LORD, according to the Torah.

        The Book of Esther or Hadassah details the events that happened around 486BC – 465BC, during the reign of the Persian king Ahasuerus also known as Xerxes I.  Esther also known as Hadassah, a Jew,  became the Queen. Esther means hidden star.

               Esther lost both of her parents. She was brought up by his senior cousin, called Mordecai. Mordecai was a gate keeper at the King’s palace, but later promoted to the position of prime minister and second in authority to the King. This was after Haman, who was originally second in authority to the King failed in his plot because Mordecai refused to bow to him. For this, Haman had plotted to kill not only Mordecia but all the Jews, to exterminate them throughout the kingdom. Haman, was the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, a descendant of Agag, the king of the Amalekites. The history of hate of the Amalekites for the Jews goes back a long way, to when the Israelites where on exodus to Canaan. There was also an encounter between king Agag of the Amalekites and king Saul of Israel.
                                                                            </Text>

        Trials and challenges of faith in one form or another come to every child of God. Several people were tested in the Bible, including Abraham’s faith. He waited a long time to have Isaac and then was asked to sacrifice him, in further test of his love for God, before God intervened with a lamb. Job or Iyov was someone who was also tested, much more severely than any other person. The word Iyov means persecuted or hated. For Job was hated by Satan, and despised by people around him, even by his friends and those he had been very kind to before his affliction. 
                                                        </Text>

               Job was a very righteous person. The most righteous in the whole world in his own time, and even God boasted about him. Then Satan took permission twice from God to severely test Job. In the first test, he lost all his possessions and children of seven sons and three daughters in one day. Job still remained faithful to God. Then Satan went to the next level of affliction. He went again to God to take permission to attack him further, with severely painful and disfiguring sickness on his body. Only his life was not to be taken. After his waves of attacks to weaken Job, Satan followed through with temptation. This was through Job’s wife asking him to deny and curse God. His very close friends who came to see him, also turned against him. They wrongly concluded Job was suffering all the calamities as punishment for some hidden sins he had committed. Job tried to prove his innocence before his friends without success. 
                                                                                           </Text>
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               But despite all the suffering and tragedy, Job remained faithful to God. In the end, God Himself spoke with Job. He showed His sovereignty, love and faithfulness. God restored to Job, double the possessions he lost. He also had children, seven sons and three daughters to replace the ones he lost. Job experienced his calamity perhaps when he was around 70years old. But after the trial, Job lived for another 140years, long enough to see four generations of his descendants: his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren. Job is mentioned along with Noah and Daniel as holy patriarchs by Ezekiel.
                                                                                            </Text>
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               The Book of Job is one of the books, the oldest book in the Old Testament. The events happened around 2,000 BC or more than 4,000 years ago. It is not clear who wrote the Book of Job, perhaps Job himself.  In which case, it may have been written between 1900BC – 1500BC. However, what is certain is that it was written outside of Israel, most likely not in Hebrew, but a foreign language and then translated. Some believe it was written or translated by Moses, while some believe it was by another person. But what is certain is that Satan continues to show intense jealousy and hatred for the elect, the holy people of God, and continues to accuse them daily before God. And Yeshua The Messiah stands before God as our Advocate and High Priest.

        The Book of Ecclesiastes or Kohelet  means The Preacher.  King Solomon, the wisest man to ever live is considered the main writer of the Book of Ecclesiastes or Kohelet. He was born a son of King David by Queen Bathsheba around 990BC and reigned over Israel from 970-931BC. From the start of his reign, Solomon asked God for one thing, which was for the wisdom to lead the people well, in a manner that would please God. So God went ahead and gave King Solomon exceptional wisdom, understanding and a vast mind. He also gave him abundance of wealth, splendor and fame. Solomon composed 3,000 (three thousand) proverbs, and 1,005 (one thousand and five) songs. In his time, people and kings from all over the earth, who had heard of his wisdom, went to listen to the Wisdom of Solomon.

               King Solomon was in search for more understanding of why things, the human life on earth, are the way they are, their good and bad. So Solomon set out to experiment with all manner of things to find answers. In many cases, he set aside the wisdom God gave him and became as it were like a fool, in order to discover the answer to his quest and questions. In the end Solomon came to discover the futility of things. We could not come to a different conclusion of Solomon, unless by someone who is a fool. Since Solomon had already conducted the experiments, using his vast wisdom and came to conclusion, we do not have to go through the same. We would be wise to avoid what he found to be bad and stay on the good side.
                                                                                                                         </Text>

               His conclusion is this: that what brings the best value of satisfaction for any human being on earth, under the sun, is to fear God and keep His commandments. This is the whole duty of mankind. Moses had already concluded this in the Book of Deuteronomy (30:19-20). Solomon had experimented and found it to be so. Only a fool will not listen. And God the Creator will bring every work into judgment, both secret and open, good and evil. All will be judged by God.

But Shulamite was not just like any other acquisition for him. Among all of the women, the Shulamite was very special, the most special to him. 
                                                                                                                          </Text>

               The love between Shulamite and Solomon was very passionate. It was described as a fierce fire that could not be extinguished by any amount of water or flood. On his part, King Solomon loved her above all other women. His love for Shulamite was so deep that he spent much time with her and wrote about their romantic life. This was despite more than 1000 other queens, concubines and young women in his life, as well as his responsibilities as a reigning king over Israel and provinces.

               The Book of Isaiah is laid out in a very identical manner as the whole Bible itself. It has a total of 66 chapters. The first 39 chapters are similar to the Old Testament and the last 27 chapters are about the New Testament. Prophet Isaiah wrote the book around 700BC, more than seven centuries before the coming of Yeshua The Messiah.
                                                                                                                                        </Text>

               Isaiah the son of Amoz is undoubtedly one of the longest serving prophet in the Bible. Isaiah received his prophetic visions during when Uzziah or Azariah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, were reigning succession as the kings of Judah. These kings reigned for a combined period of 113 years. And Uzziah reigned for 52 years. Even if Isaiah began to prophesy a few years before the death of Uzziah, and continued until the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah, then Isaiah would still have prophesied for a period of 70years or more. His prophesies have all been fulfilled in their set time. The rest are waiting to be fulfilled in the end time.
                                                                                                                                         </Text>

               Through his prophecies, Isaiah revealed the greatness of God. At one time, he saw a vision of God on His Throne, with Seraphim angels praising Him. This was in the year that Uzziah died.

He issued the decree that freed the Jews to return back from Babylon to Jerusalem.

Jonah initially refused. Part of this may be because the Assyrians had been a wicked enemy to Israel. Assyrian was then the world super power, with its capital in Nineveh. Neneveh was a well defended city and believed to have a city wall around it of about 100ft high, wide enough for three chariots to ride side by side. At this time Babylon was under their rule as a subject.

The whole of that generation of mankind, was judged by God to have departed from His ways, and gone into all manners of sins and evil. The Scripture says that the wickedness (sins, abominations) of the people throughout the earth was great, and every desire of the thoughts in their hearts was only evil continuously, (Genesis 6:1-7). They had gone totally apostate, away from God. So, that generation was destroyed and brought to an end through flood, which covered the whole world. Only Noah, his wife, their three sons and their wives, a total of eight people, were saved.

The Book of Leviticus also contains details of the laws governing how the Levite priests were to perform their services. Nadab and Abihu, two sons of Aaron the High Priest, who failed to follow God’s instruction and offered strange fire sacrifices were killed (not by any human hand) in the middle of their ceremony.

               In Hebrew, this fourth Book is known as Bamidbar. The word Bamidbar means ‘in the desert or wilderness’. Most of the events of the Book of Bamidbar took place in the wilderness, as the  Israelites traveled from Sinai to the Canaan the promised land.  In Greek or English translation, this fourth Book is called Numbers. One of the first event in the Book of Numbers was the numbering, the headcountor census of the Israelites. All of the first generation of Israelites who were numbered in the census did not make it to Canaan. It was the second generation, their children born in the desert who made it. Their number was about the same as of the first generation who started from Egypt. A perfect replacement for the old.
                                                                                                       </Text>

               Despite God’s mighty miracles, and His leading them by the pillar of the cloud at day time, and fire at night time, the people continued to doubt God, grumble and complain.  The Book of Numbers details the disobedience, rebellion and disbelief of the people of Israel and God’s punishment for them. This included of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram and those they led in their rebellion against Moses. The ground opened up and swallowed them. The first generation that left Egypt wasted in the desert due to disobedience. They wandered during the forty years, until they were all wasted (died) away. It was their children that entered the land of Canaan. Miriam, Aaron and Moses also had their share of disobedience and punished by God. Miriam the prophetess and leader of the women became rebellious in the desert, against Moses. This was because of Moses’ wife who was an Ethiopian.  God punished Miriam with leprosy and Moses had to intercede on her behalf. She later died without seeing or entering Canaan. Aaron was also disobedient. He took part along with Miriam in the rebellion against Moses. And also Aaron along with Moses were together disobedient to God when they struck the rock twice, instead of speaking to bring out water. God punished them for dishonoring God before the people. Both Moses and Aaron were preventing from entering the promised land. Aaron died without seeing it. Moses was allowed to see it, but not to enter. Other notable people in the Book of Numbers included Joshua and Caleb, the only two of the first generation who left Egypt that entered Canaan. There were other people such as Balak and Balaam (and his donkey who spoke). Balak paid Balaam to curse Israelites but instead blessed them. God also gave additional laws including of the Nazirite, cities of refuge, and others, to guide the Israelites.

He also repeatedly warned the Israelites about the consequences of sins and of the reward for obedience.

               It is a very powerful prophetic Book that runs alongside that of Daniel. Prophet Daniel’s prophecy was focused on the human kingdoms and their fall over time, from Babylon to the last one being the Antichrist kingdom. Prophet Zechariah on the other hand focuses on how the Kingdom of God gradually rises, with the plan of God, and ultimately replaces the last human kingdom of the Antichrist in the end time.

               Prophet Zechariah was a contemporary of prophet Haggai. Both Prophet Haggai and Prophet Zechariah were two outstanding prophets who encouraged Zerubbabel, Joshua and the people of Judah to continue the building of the Temple after their return from captivity in Babylon. The rebuilding work started in 536BC, and was completed in 516BC after a series of oppositions from the enemy.

        Daniel in Greek or Daniyyel in Hebrew and Aramaic means “God is my judge”.  Prophet Daniel was of royal descent of Judah, who was taken into captivity in Babylon around 605BC. This was when king Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquered Jerusalem. He took some members of the royal family of king Jehoiakim, some other nobles of royal descent, along with some of the people from the tribe of Judah. He took them as prisoners and captives, his reward or plunder to Babylon. Daniel was one of the royal family taken. Daniel and his three friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were among those taken to Babylon. He was a youth, believed to be about 16years old, born around 620BC.
                                                                         </Text>
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               The Babylonians, like the Canaanites were very deep in idolatry. It was a typical practice to give new names to prisoners or captives. They named their most prized ones after their gods. King Nebuchadnezzar changed Daniel’s name to Belteshazzar, meaning Bel protect his life.  Bel (also known as Baal) was the chief god or idol worshipped by the Babylonians.
                                                                                                                          </Text>

               Daniel served as lead adviser for more than sixty years, during the successive reigns of the three kings of Babylon, namely Nebuchadnezzar, his son Eveel-Merodach,  and grandson Belshazzar. They ruled Babylon until conquered by King Cyrus of Medo-Persia, during the reign of Belshazzar. 
                                                                                                                                         </Text>

               While in captivity in Babylon, Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the Babylonian way of life. He kept himself pure and faithful to God Almighty, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

               In return, God gave exceptional wisdom and ability to interpret dreams and visions to Daniel. He was described by the Babylonians as having the wisdom of the ‘gods’. God also gave several prophetic revelations to Daniel. It started when king Nechadnezzar had a dream he could not understand. It disturbed him greatly, and he threatened to kill all his wisemen and magicians who did not know or interpret the dream. Daniel called his three friends and they prayed to God about it. And God revealed it to Daniel at night. God went on to give several more visions to Daniel about the various future ruling kingdoms of the world that would arise from the time of Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to the end time kingdom of The Beast or Antichrist.

               The Jews who returned from exile in Babylon had enjoyed spiritual revival under Ezra, prophets Haggai and Zechariah. But at the time of Prophet Malachi, they were backsliding again very rapidly.

               The Levite priests thought they were doing a great job. This was not the case. God rebuked and warned them of their corruption and wickedness. They kept the best part of the offerings for themselves and offered sick and blemish sacrifices to God. The first two chapters of the Book of Zechariah contained God’s displeasure, and warning for them.

               The people on their part had also stopped bringing their tithes and offerings. God spoke through Malachi to encourage them to start giving. He said they should do it, test Him, to see if He would not bless them abundantly.
                                                                       </Text>

               We continue to see similar scenario in Churches, as we enter the end time. The priests, pastors and shepherds preach tithing and offering for the people to bring. They quote heavily from the Book of Malachi to collect tithes and offering from members. Yet these priests, pastors and so-called shepherds take the tithes and offerings for their own personal pleasures. They indulge in a lifestyle of luxury. They forget the widows, orphans, strangers, and the poor of their members and of the society. Instead of building souls for the Kingdom of God, they are profiting from it for themselves. 
                                                                       </Text>

They reigned in succession for a total period of 113 years as kings over Judah.

The Book of Hosea is believed to have been written during the early years of the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah, between 750BC and 725BC.

He was to reveal the design of the Temple, its specifications, all its prescriptions, all its form and all its directions (laws) to them if they are ashamed of all that they have done. It is either Ezekiel did not reveal this to them because they did not fully repent or they received it, but did not proceed to build it. But a Temple will be built when The Messiah returns in the end time. The glory that will be of this Temple will be greater than the former.

                Towards the end of the Book, Ezekiel also prophesied about the end time. He prophesied about Gog and magog who Satan will use after the millennium to lead his deception and rebellion. Gog of magog is the equivalent of the Antichrist that comes after the millennium reign. That will be Satan’s third period of deception or rebellion through people against God. The first was from Adam’s time to Noah. The second is from after the flood to our own end time. The third will be after the Millennium.

                Prophet Ezekiel also saw the visions of the end time Jerusalem, living water flowing out of the Temple, as well as trees with healing lives at the banks of the river.

        Lamentations or Ekhah means weeping or sorrowful grief. Jeremiah or Yirmeyah was one of the major prophets in the Old Testament. The Book of Lamentations or Ekhah is what Prophet Jeremiah wrote in his sorrowful grief over the fall of Jerusalem. Jeremiah personally witnessed this and wrote this Book after the fall and destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon in around 586BC. The Book also teaches about the consequences of disobedience to God after repeated warnings. 
                                                                                         </Text>
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               Jeremiah was also referred to as the “weeping prophet” because of his deep sadness over the fall of Jerusalem, Judah, her people and their going into captivity. He repeatedly warned them ahead about this, but they would not listen. 
                                                                                                                                                        </Text>               
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               Jeremiah lived between 650BC and 570BC. He was called by God to be a prophet even before his birth and started his ministry when he was a youth.  He prophesied during the reign of Josiah, Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin and Zedekiah, the last king of Judah before their captivity. 
                                                                                                                                                                       </Text>               
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               During this time, he prophesied. Apart from the Book of Lamentations or Ekhah, he  also wrote the Book of Jeremiah or Yirmeyah, as well as  the Books of Kings (I and II).
