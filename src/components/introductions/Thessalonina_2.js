        The Book of 2 Thessalonians also known as The Second Epistle or Iggeret to the Thessalonians is the fourteenth book of the New Testament. It was written by Apostle Paul to the Church or Community (Kehillah) of The Messiah in Thessalonica between 51AD-52AD.         </Text>
               <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
               This was Apostle Paulâ€™s second letter to them. He corrected the wrong doctrine going on that Yeshua The Messiah had already returned.  He went on to discuss that there will first be a falling away and also the rise of the Antichrist, the man of sin or of perdition.                  </Text>
